<p>By the death of every person something within the range of
his study and knowledge is lost beyond recovery. In publishing
this book of memories it is my desire to rescue from oblivion
persons and events coming under my observation during
a long life, and to make a record of habits, customs and fashions
which have prevailed at different periods within my knowledge.
The book is not intended to be either in any sense an autobiography,
or a mere collection of interesting reminiscences, but a
legacy which I wish to leave for the benefit of those coming after
me. I cannot permit its publication without a grateful acknowledgment
of the service rendered during its preparation
by friends too numerous to be mentioned by name in contributing
material essential to its approximate completeness and accuracy.</p>

<p>In writing these memories I have in mind both the old and
the young. With the old I may perhaps clear away some of
the cobwebs which obscure their backward glance and reopen
to their vision vistas of the past. With the young I may
perhaps show how their fathers and grandfathers lived,
and how through the results of their careers, the comforts and
luxuries of the present generation have been evolved from the
simple habits and ways of living of those who have gone before.
An important lesson may be learned by the young, that,
in this process of evolution, the achievements of today are only
the culmination of the continuous labors of earlier generations;
that all we are, and all we know, came to us from our fathers;
and that the wonderful inventions and discoveries of which we
boast, as if they were ours alone, would have been impossible
without the lessons taught by the inventors and discoverers
who blazed the way for our feet to tread.</p>

<p>Let me premise, without intending to enter the domain of
history, by answering three questions, which, perhaps oftener
than any others, are asked by visitors, and by young Plymoutheans
who are beginning to study the career of their native
town. The first question is—how and from whom did Plymouth
receive its name? This question has been somewhat confused
by the intimation of some writers that the name owes its
origin, at least in part, to the Pilgrims. The facts show conclusively
that such is not the case. In 1614 John Smith arrived
on the coast of New England in command of an expedition
fitted out under the patronage of Sir Ferdinando Gorges,
the Governor of the castle in old Plymouth. Anchoring his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
ships near the mouth of the present Penosbcot river he embarked
in a shallop to explore the coast, with the hope of making
such discoveries of mines of gold and copper, and of finding
such opportunities of obtaining a cargo of fish and furs, as
would at least defray the expenses of his expedition. While
on his exploring trip he “drew a map from point to point, isle
to isle, and harbor to harbor, with the soundings, sands, rocks
and landmarks,” and gave the country the name of New England
instead of Virginia, the name by which it had been
previously known. Making a chart of the coast from the Penobscot
to Cape Cod, he placed it on his return in the hands of
Gorges, who submitted it to the inspection of Prince Charles,
afterwards Charles the first, who affixed to it the names of
three localities, which have adhered to them up to the present
time. These were, Plymouth, probably named in honor of
Gorges, the governor of the Plymouth castle, and the patron
of Smith’s expedition; Charles River, named after himself, and
Cape Ann named after his mother, Ann of Denmark. Other
names affixed by the Prince were Stuard’s Bay for Cape Cod
Bay, Cape James for Cape Cod, Oxford and London for two
localities between Plymouth and what is now Boston, Cheviot
Hills for the Blue Hills, and Bristol, Southampton, Hull, Ipswich,
Dartmouth, Sandwich, Cambridge and Leith.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Morton, in his New England’s Memorial, published
in 1669, suggested that the Pilgrims adopted the name for
the above reason, and also because “Plymouth in old England
was the last town they left in their native country, and because
they received many kindnesses from some Christians there.”
It seems to me that Morton was unfortunate in the use of language.
If he had said that the name given by Prince Charles
was agreeable to the Pilgrims on account of its associations
with their last port of departure, he would have undoubtedly
spoken the truth, but it should not be stated that a name, already
conferred on the landing place of the Pilgrims, was originated
five years after its well known place on Smith’s map.
That the Pilgrims knew of the name there can be no doubt.
Capt. Thomas Dermer was at Plymouth in the summer of
1620, and wrote a letter to Gorges, dated, Plymouth, in July
of that year, advising any colony of fifty or more to settle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
there. That letter must have reached Gorges before the Mayflower
sailed from old Plymouth on the 6th of September, and
of its contents the Pilgrims must have been made acquainted
by Gorges, who was their adviser and friend. Besides, Edward
Winslow wrote a letter to England from “Plymouth in
New England,” dated December 11th, 1620, the very day of
the Landing, a date too early for any formal action to have
been taken by the Colony concerning a name for the locality;
and further, Winslow uses the term, “New England,” a title
which Smith alone had given to the Northern part or Virginia,
and which probably appeared nowhere else than on his map.</p>

<p>The second question is—when was Plymouth incorporated.
The direct answer to this question, that Plymouth was never
incorporated, would be very unsatisfactory without some explanation
of the relations existing between the Colony and the
town of Plymouth. It is all very well to speak of the settlement
of the town instead of its incorporation, and fix the date
at 1620, but the precise time, when the line was drawn between
the colony and town, and when the town was clothed by official
authority with the functions of a municipality, it is impossible
to fix. In the records of 1626 Plymouth is called a plantation;
in a deed dated, 1631, from John to Edward Winslow,
the town of Plymouth is referred to; in accordance with the
law passed by the General Court requiring towns to choose
constables, one was chosen in Plymouth in 1633; and in 1638
at a meeting held for the purpose of considering the disposition
of the gift of stock by James Sherley of London for the
benefit of the poor of the town, it was decided “that the town
should be considered as extending from the lands of Wm.
Pontus and John Dunham (now the lands of Thomas O.
Jackson) on the south, to the outside of New street (now
North street) on the north. Finally in the year 1637 the first
entry in the town records was made, and on the second day of
November, 1640, it was ordered at a meeting of the Court of
Assistants that “whereas by the Act of the General Court held
the third of March in the sixteenth year of his Majesties now
reign, the Governor and Assistants were authorized to set the
bounds of the several townships, it is enacted and concluded by
the Court that the bounds of Plymouth township shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
extend southwards to the bounds of Sandwich township,
and northward to the little brook falling into Black
Water from the commons left to Duxbury, and the neighborhood
thereabouts, and westward eight miles up into the lands
from any part of the bay or sea; always provided that the
bounds shall extend so far up into the woodlands as to include
the South Meadows toward Agawam, lately discovered, and
the convenient uplands thereabouts.” But notwithstanding
all these references, it is enough to say that Plymouth was
settled in 1620, but never formally incorporated.</p>

<p>The third question is: What was the disease which carried
off one-half of the Plymouth Colony during the first four
months after the landing. In answer to this question only
plausible conjectures can be made. Various theories have
been suggested by medical men and others, but unfortunately
insufficient data as to the symptoms and general characteristics
of the epidemic have been handed down to us to enable any
definite diagnosis to be made. Some have suggested smallpox,
and some yellow fever, some cholera and some quick consumption.
Some also have raised the question whether the
germs of the disease, which swept off the Indians living in
Plymouth four or five years before, still lurking in the soil or
in vegetation, might not have retained sufficient vitality to develop
in the human system. This last suggestion would afford
little satisfaction, for the question would remain unsolved
as to the nature of the disease. After much thought given
to the matter, I have come to what I think is the most natural
conclusion, that the disease was what was well known in the
days of Irish immigration, before ocean steam navigation was
available, as ship fever. Many readers will remember that
packet ships and transient vessels were constantly arriving at
New York and Boston, crowded with immigrants—after long
passages from England, and that long confinement below deck
resulted frequently in the breaking out of ship fever and caused
serious mortality. The voyage of the Mayflower from Southampton
to Cape Cod harbor was more than ninety days in
length, and during that time imperfect ventilation and inadequate
nourishment in a vessel of only one hundred and eighty
tons, carrying within her walls one hundred and twenty crew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and passengers, must have furnished all the conditions necessary
for the presence of that terrible infection, which in our
own day was so fatal to the immigrants from Ireland.</p>

<p>Let me further premise, in closing this introductory chapter,
by saying that, of events occurring during a period of seventy-five
years, of the changes in the external character of Plymouth,
and of the manners and customs and ways of living of
its people, I have a distinct recollection. Some of these, at a
still earlier period, I can imperfectly recall. For instance in
1825, when I was a few months more than three years of age,
my mother carried me on a visit to her father in Shelburne,
Nova Scotia, and while I recall nothing of the voyage made in
a fishing schooner on her way to the Grand Banks, the accuracy
of my memory concerning many localities in Shelburne,
was confirmed on a visit to that place twenty-six years later in
1851. My grandfather, Gideon White, a native of Plymouth,
and a descendant from Peregrine White, was a loyalist during
the revolution, and, holding a Captain’s commission in the
British army, served with his regiment in Jamaica during the
war. With other loyalists he settled in Shelburne, where,
receiving the appointment of Provincial Judge, he afterwards
lived, making occasional visits to England, but none to the
United States, until his death in 1833. He married Deborah
Whitworth, the daughter of Miles Whitworth, a British Army
surgeon, and four of his children married in Boston and Plymouth
and Cambridge, while a son graduated at Harvard in
1812.</p>

<p>I remember, too, that at the age of four, in 1826, I was carried
to my first school. It was kept by Mrs. Martha Weston,
who was known as Mrs. Patty, or more generally Ma’am Weston,
the widow of Coomer Weston, and grandmother of our
townsman, Myles S. Weston, in the house on North street, the
third below that of Miss Dr. Pierce, not long since occupied
by Wm. W. Brewster. I remember well the school room, its
sanded floor and the cricket on which I sat. From that dear
old lady, with a pleasant smile and kindly voice, I first tasted
the “sweet food of kindly uttered knowledge.” She died July
27, 1841, and but few of her scholars can now be left to join
with me in blessing her memory.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to a general consideration of the streets
and ways of Plymouth, and their changes, this is a fitting place
to refer to an important alteration, in one of its chief highways,
which, though occurring during my life time, is a little beyond
the scope of my memory. In ancient times the route from
Plymouth to Sandwich was through the district of “half way
ponds,” which thus received its name. When a stage line
between the two towns was established the route ran through
Chiltonville, leaving Bramhall’s corner on the right, and passing
over Eel River bridge, turned to the right and by a diagonal
course reached a point on the present road near the estate of
Mr. Jordan. At that time the road through Clark’s valley
by the cotton factory extended no farther south than the cross
roads leading to the Russell Mills on the west, and by the old
Edes &amp; Wood factory on the east.</p>

<p>In 1825 this road was extended, making a junction with the
old road, and thus establishing the present Plymouth and Sandwich
highway.</p>

<p>In 1830 there were in Plymouth, north of Bramhall’s corner
in Chiltonville, seventeen streets so called, thirteen lanes, three
squares, nine places and ways, and four alleys, concerning all
of which something will be said in their order. The streets
were Court, Howland, Main, North, Water, Middle, Leyden,
School, Market, Spring, High, Summer, Pleasant, Sandwich,
Commercial, Green and South streets. Court street, which
took its present name by a vote of the town in 1823, owes its
origin to no formal laying out. It practically followed the old
Massachusetts path, and was a way of necessity gradually
evolved from a footway, and bridle path, and cart way to its
present condition. There is a tradition, which needs confirmation,
that opposite the head of the present Murray street, it
once made a detour to the west through the valley in the rear
of the houses of Mr. Charles G. Hathaway and others, and
came out into the present road at some point beyond Cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Spring. There seems to have been no necessity for such a detour,
and no available route for it to pursue, and I am inclined
to the belief that the tradition is unfounded. There is another
tradition, which may also be distrusted, that Tinker’s Rock
Spring, now known as Cold Spring, was removed by an earthquake
in 1755 from the east to the west side of the street, where
it now flows. There can be no doubt that it once flowed on
the east side, but I was told by Mr. John Kempton Cobb, who
always lived in the neighborhood of the spring, and would be
now, if he were living, one hundred and nineteen years of age,
that it was moved by owners of a pasture on the west side to
supply water for their cattle. Within my own knowledge for
many years the water after it left the pipe, turned into and out
of the pasture referred to, before it crossed the street and
passed through the Nelson field on its way to the harbor.
When the trench was opened in 1904 for the purpose of laying
a sewer, I noticed that the water from the site of the old
spring on the east side was conveyed to the present outlet,
through a pipe laid across the street, for which the story of the
earthquake would fail to account. The boundaries of Court
street, notwithstanding widenings and straightenings in various
places, have remained practically as they were in 1830,
except in two places. Until 1851, at what is now the head of
Murray street, there was a watering place on the east side,
through which teams were driven to water their horses. In
the above year the easterly line of the street was straightened,
and the old watering place thrown into the adjoining lots.
The brook at this place was called “second brook” by the Pilgrims,
the “first brook” being that which in my boyhood was
called “Shaw’s brook,” and which flows, or recently did flow,
between the houses of Mrs. Helen F. Hedge and Mr. Ripley,
through pipes under the brick block to the harbor. The
above mentioned “second brook” flows from a spring just
within the lot on the west side of the street, and the bridge
over it was long ago the terminus of the evening walks of loving
couples who, as they turned for home formally rechristened
the bridge in the most natural way as “Kissing
bridge.” The other place where the street underwent an important
change was at the corner of North street, which in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
1892 was cut off to meet the necessities of travel then increased
by the recent construction of the street railway.</p>

<p>The greatest change which Court street has passed through
in my day, has been brought about by the rows of elm trees
along its sidewalks, all of which have been set out since 1830,
and most of them as far as Cold Spring by the late Andrew L.
Russell, to whose public spirit the town is chiefly indebted for
one of its crowning glories. In the above year the only
shade trees within the bounds of Main and Court streets, between
Town Square and Cold Spring, were two ash trees in
front of the house on the southerly corner of North street.
North of the trees set out by Mr. Russell were the old mile
tree, which stood in front of the estate of the late Joab Thomas,
and the trees beyond the estate of Mrs. Knapp, for which the
town is indebted to the late Leavitt T. Robbins, father of our
late townsman of the same name. The mile tree was struck
by lightning in 1829, and not long after was blown down and
replaced by that now standing. The beauty which these trees
have added to the town, even lending grace and ornament to
the many houses of ordinary styles of architecture along Court
street, suggests a remark made many years ago by John Quincy
Adams, while walking with a friend one bleak cloudy day in
March, in reply to his companion who had expressed a wonder
that the Pilgrims settled here. “Oh,” Mr. Adams answered,
“you must remember that there were no houses here then.”
Mr. Adams must have been another Jonathan who</p>

<p>Howland street was laid out August 6, 1728, by Thomas
Howland, through his land, and by deed of that date, under
the name of Howland street, was dedicated to public use. For
more than a hundred years it extended only as far as the present
westerly line of the Gas works land, though originally laid
out to the shore, but on the tenth of September, 1859, it was
formally laid out in accordance with the original intent of Mr.
Howland.</p>

<p>Main street, once called Hanover street, like Court street,
was one of the original ways, not formally laid out, but from
time to time changed along its lines. The first important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
change was effected May 26, 1851, by straightening the westerly
line from the corner of the land now owned by Wm. P. Stoddard,
to the Plymouth Bank Building. Up to that time the
Thomas house, now the Plymouth tavern, had a front yard perhaps
twenty feet deep, and the law office of Wm. Thomas was
on the southeast corner of the lot. Next south of the Thomas
house and land, was an old house built out to the Thomas line,
and both estates were cut off at the above date, thus establishing
the present line of the street. Another important change
was made August 3, 1886, by running a new line on the westerly
side from the bank to Town Square, moving all the buildings
back to the line, and giving the street at the narrowest point
between Middle and Leyden streets, a width of fifty-eight feet
seven inches. Its present name of Main street was adopted
by the town in 1823. Middle street was laid out August 6,
1725, by Jonathan Bryant, Consider Howland, Isaac Little and
Mayhew Little, owners of the land “for and in consideration of
the public good, and for the more regular and uniform situation
of the town of Plymouth, and to be forever hereafter called
King street.” At the time of the revolution it informally
received its present name, which was finally adopted by the
town in 1823, and on the 6th of March, 1899, it was widened
to its present width. The way from the foot of the street to
Water street, which for the purposes of this narrative, may be
considered a part of the street, was laid out September 21,
1768, and May 13, 1807.</p>

<p>Two remarkable coincidences have occurred in connection
with Middle street. In the early part of the 18th century one
of the Bryant family kept a tavern on the corner of Main and
Middle streets, which is called on the records Bryant’s tavern,
and in 1834 Danville Bryant kept a tavern on the same site.
The other coincidence relates to the third Parish, which was
established in Middle street, and built a meeting house in 1744,
where the house occupied by Mr. Frink now stands. Rev.
Thomas Frink of Rutland, Vt., was settled as its pastor, and
more than a hundred years later our present townsman, bearing
the same name, came to Plymouth, and now lives on the same
site. These coincidences are constantly occurring as if men
were mere puppets following unconsciously certain predestined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
lines. When the Plymouth Woolen Mill went into operation
about 1865, a Scotchman by the name of Fernside was
employed as a wool sorter. After the manufacture of flannels
was abandoned he bought and settled on land in Duxbury,
which a man of the same name occupied more than two hundred
years before. A story of what perhaps may be called a
coincidence, was told me by our townsman Wm. Burns. He
came from Scotland, and on his arrival between 1850 and 1860,
was employed in the Cordage Company’s store at Seaside.
One day a man drove up to the store, and as he alighted, Mr.
Burns said to him, “Good morning, Mr. Glass,—when did
you come over?” “What do you mean by coming
over?” replied the man. “Why, from Scotland,” said
Mr. Burns. “I never was in Scotland, my ancestors have
lived in Duxbury since about 1640.” “Is not your name
Glass?” continued Mr. Burns. “Yes,” said the man.
“Why, I thought you were Mr. Glass, a neighbor of
mine in Scotland,” said Mr. Burns. This may, however, not
have been a coincidence, but a remarkable perpetuation of a
family type. I have had in my own experience more than
one illustration of the descent of family types, through many
generations, one of which recently occurred. A stranger met me
in the street and asked me if I was Mr. Davis. I said, “Yes,
and your name is Howland.” “How do you know that?” he
asked, “I have never seen you before.” I said, “I know by
your hand with its web fingers,” instances of which I have
known in five generations of the family of Henry Howland,
one of the early members of the Plymouth Colony. It is true
that he might have descended from a female Howland, and
thus borne another name, but I was right in calling him by
that name.</p>

<p>North street was laid out in 1633, and at various times was
called New street, Queen street, Howland street and North
street, which last name was adopted by the town in 1823. The
upper half of the street, on its northerly side, has been changed
since 1830 by the erection of the following houses; that of Dr.
Brown, built in 1833 by Jacob Covington, on the site of the old
Marcy house; the next house built in 1830 by Rev. Frederick
Freeman, the pastor of the Trinitarian Congregational church;
the easterly addition of the house of the late Edward L. Barnes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
on the site of the house of Capt. William Rogers, and the
house now occupied by Isaac M. Jackson, built about 1850, by
Thomas T. Jackson, on the site of a house, which within my
memory, was occupied by William Morton Jackson, and Richard
Bagnall and others.</p>

<p>On the upper half of the street on the southerly side the following
houses have been built since 1830; that built in 1838 by
Ebenezer G. Parker, the cashier of the Old Colony Bank, and
now occupied by the Misses Russell; that built in 1832 by Mrs.
Betsey H. Hodge, recently occupied by Mrs. Thomas B. Drew;
that occupied by Benjamin A. Hathaway, and built by Abraham
Jackson on the site of one previously occupied by him,
which was built about 1745 by Colonel George Watson; and
finally the public library building built by the heirs of William
G. Russell and Mary Ellen, his wife, on a part of the old Jackson
land.</p>

<p>On the lower half of the street there have been several
changes in its boundaries. From the way leading to the oil
works, as Winslow street was called, at a point in front of the
Willoughby house, there was for many years a way with steps
running easterly and reaching the street below at an acute
angle, thus breaking the continuity of the stone wall bounding
the street. About 1858, while I was chairman of the selectmen,
the board discontinued this way, and rebuilt the wall on
a continuous line.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street there was another way with
steps at its upper and lower ends opening opposite the northerly
door of the Plymouth Rock House, and reaching the street
below immediately above the house which stood on the corner
of Water street. This way has also been discontinued by the
selectmen. Through my youth a row of balm of Gilead trees
stood below the wall extending from the elm tree in front of
the house of Mrs. Ruth H. Baker to the way above mentioned.
The Linden tree standing on the corner of Cole’s Hill,
has an interesting romance associated with it. The tree was
planted by a youthful couple as a memorial of their engagement,
and when not long afterwards, in 1809, the engagement
was discontinued, and the memorial was no longer prized by
the lady in whose garden it had been planted, she one day pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
it up, and threw it into the street. My father, who happened
to pass at the time, picked it up and planted it where it
now stands. He lived in the house now known as the Plymouth
Rock House, where he died in 1824, and under his careful
nursing it survived its treatment, and has grown into the
beautiful tree, now blessing so many with its grateful shade.
In that house I was born in 1822, and lived until I was more
than twenty years of age, and hundreds of times I have climbed
the branches of the Linden, often with book in hand, seeking
shelter from the summer sun.</p>

<p>North street received a new laying out February 11, 1716,
and still another on the 7th of October, 1765, and after the estates
on Water street below Cole’s Hill had been bought by the
Pilgrim Society in 1856, and other dates, land was thrown out
by the society, and the corner rounded.</p>

<p>So far as the houses on the lower half of North street are
concerned, several changes have occurred since 1830. In my
boyhood the double house now partly occupied by Miss Catherine
Kendall, was a single house, occupied by the widow of
Edward Taylor, who was then the wife of John Blaney Bates,
whom she married in 1807. After the death of Mrs. Bates
and her husband, whom I well remember, Jacob and Abner
Sylvester Taylor, sons of Mrs. Bates, remodelled the house
and divided it into two tenements. John Blaney Bates, the
second husband of Mrs. Taylor, was one of the most skilful
masons and master builders in southeastern Massachusetts, and
was largely engaged in enterprises in other towns. He built
the Plymouth Court House in 1820, the Barnstable Court
House, and as many as eight or ten brick or stone dwelling
houses on Summer street and Winthrop Place in Boston. A
contract to build a house of hammered stone for George Bond
in Winthrop Place, proved a disastrous one, and terminated his
business career. After the failure of Whitwell and Bond, the
house referred to was sold to Henry Cabot, the grandfather of
Henry Cabot Lodge, and occupied by him until Winthrop
Place was extended to Franklin street, and made a part of the
present Devonshire street. Mr. Bates, as I remember him,
was in his later days an inveterate sportsman, and would often
spend hours behind an ice hummock, when the harbor was partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
frozen, waiting for a possible shot at ducks in a sheet of
open water near by. He died in 1831.</p>

<p>His stepsons, the Taylor brothers, who learned their mason’s
trade with him, also became skilful workmen and contractors
in Plymouth and neighboring towns. In 1824 they
built Pilgrim Hall for the Pilgrim Society, and Mr. Taylor
told me that when they signed the contract in July, the stone
was lying undisturbed in a virgin rock on the easterly side of
Queen Ann’s turnpike in Weymouth, and the timber stood uncut
in the forests of Maine. So expeditiously, however, was
the work performed that the hall was occupied by the Society
at the anniversary celebration in the following December.</p>

<p>The house next east of the Taylor house was built in 1829 by
the Messrs. Taylor on land of the Taylor estate. The Taylors
had completed in that year their contract to build Long wharf
and, having considerable material left, they put it into this
house. I remember hearing it said that the partitions, and
perhaps the walls, were constructed of some of the plank used
in covering the wharf, and were consequently unusually solid
and firm. The story was told that when Deacon Wm. P. Ripley,
who bought the house, went to inspect it, he was told by
one of the brothers that the partitions were so impervious to
sound that conversation could not be heard from room to room.
To confirm his statement he invited the Deacon to test it. After
the doors were closed, the Deacon in one room and Mr.
Taylor in another, the former called out loudly—“Do you
hear?” and the answer “No,” came promptly back. The Deacon
evidently was willing to take Mr. Taylor’s word, thus
confirmed, and bought the house. Deacon Ripley, son of Nathaniel
and Elizabeth (Bartlett) Ripley, was born in Plymouth
in 1775, and after his first marriage in 1805, owned and occupied
the house on Summer street, which after 1845 was owned
and occupied by Benjamin Hathaway. He kept a dry goods
store in that house many years, and after the sale of the house
in 1833 to the heirs of Robert Dunham, the store was occupied
by the millinery establishment of Mrs. Thomas Long, one of
the heirs. After giving up the store, Deacon Ripley entered
into a partnership with his son-in-law, Andrew S. March, in
Boston, under the firm name of Ripley &amp; March, 21 Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
street, but finally returned to Plymouth and took the store
afterwards occupied by Southworth Barnes, on the site of the
present Sherman block. He died November 10, 1842, and in
the next year the house on North street was sold to Phineas
Wells, to whom reference will be hereafter made.</p>

<p>Within my recollection no persons have been universally
called Deacons, irrespective of their church connections, besides
Deacon Ripley and Deacon John Hall. The latter was
many years Deacon of the Baptist church, and was a farmer
living at the corner of Court and Hall streets, where he raised
a family of sons, well known by the last generations as industrious,
useful and worthy citizens.</p>

<p>In his church he was the supervisor of every act. I remember
that on one occasion the minister announced from the pulpit
that on the next Thursday evening “the Lord willing, there
will be a prayer meeting in this house, the weather permitting,
if Deacon Hall has no objections, and on Friday evening,
whether or no.”</p>

<p>In middle life the Deacon bought a sloop and employed her
in fishing, and in taking fishing parties into the bay. He scorned
the fishing ledges generally resorted to, such as the Offer
ledge, the House ledge, Faunce’s ledge and the Thrum Caps,
and fished on ledges of his own, the bearings of which he kept
to himself. I was with him once, one of a party of ten, and
before ten o’clock, the party caught one hundred and sixty
cod and one hundred and forty haddock. In those days haddock
were thought an inferior fish, and were difficult to dispose
of in the Plymouth market at one cent a pound. In fact,
they were not even dignified by the name of “fish,” and I remember
hearing a servant ordered to get a fish at the fish
market, and if he could not get a fish, to get a haddock.</p>

<p>But some critical person found worms between the flakes
of a codfish, and then another discovered that a haddock made
a superior fry, and still another that in a chowder the flesh
of a haddock was firmer than that of a codfish, and finally
both came to be held in equal estimation. In my early days no
lover of salt cod would eat anything but dunfish, and Deacon
Hall was the only person in Plymouth, who cured them,
Swampscott being generally looked to for a supply. They received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
their name from their dun color, which was of a reddish
brown. They were caught in the spring, slack salted,
and when partially dry, piled in a dark room covered with seaweed.
After several weeks they were repiled, and after
several weeks more, they were ready to be eaten.</p>

<p>In my mother’s day short, thick fish were selected for the
table, and every Saturday three were served with a napkin
above and below, the upper one being removed to the kitchen,
and the middle one eaten, while the other two supplied minced
fish for Sunday’s breakfast, and the Monday washing day
dinner. A slice of dunfish cut up with potatoes, beets, carrots
and onions, well covered with pork scraps and sweet oil, judiciously
peppered, makes a dinner, which, with the white salt
fish of today, it is impossible to prepare. Fish balls were not
in vogue in my early days, but gradually took the place of
mince fish, especially Sunday morning. Baked beans, now
improperly called distinctively a New England dish, were
according to my recollection, unknown in Plymouth, and were
associated exclusively with Beverly, whose people were called
Beverly beaners. A story was told of a vessel at sea running
down to a schooner in distress, and finding that she was from
Beverly, and out of beans. The first dish of baked beans I
ever saw, was on a club dining table in Cambridge, after I
entered college in 1838.</p>

<p>Deacon Hall understood the art of making a chowder as
well as that of curing dunfish, or if his fishing party preferred
a muddle, that is, a chowder with no potatoes and less liquor,
he was equally skilful. Real lovers of fish and seafaring men
I have generally found liked the muddle, as perhaps the following
incident will attest. Capt. Ignatius Pierce, a man of
dry humor, spent a number of years in California, never intimating
in his letters any intention of an immediate return
home. His wife, about nine o’clock one morning, received a
telegram from him in Boston, merely saying, “have a muddle
for dinner.”</p>

<p>The good Deacon would have been amused at the following
description of the ingredients of a genuine New England
chowder by a professor of modern languages in the University
of Virginia, in a work published by him in 1872, “A many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
sided dish of pork and fish, potatoes and bread, onions and
turnips all mixed up with fresh chequits and seabass, black
fish and long clams, pumpkinseed, and an accidental eel, well
peppered and salted, piled up in layers, and stewed together.”
If such a dish as that had been placed before the Deacon he
would in a changed form have followed the directions for
cooking a coot—to wit, shoot your coot, pick it, parboil it, stuff
it, roast it, baste it, and then throw it away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p>During my early life a house stood in North street between
the house of Mrs. Ruth H. Baker and the present Plymouth
Rock House, concerning the occupants of which I must say a
word. It was a double house, the westerly end of which was
occupied by Ebenezer Drew, his wife Deborah, or Aunt Debby,
as she was called, and his brother Malachi. Ebenezer had
no children and Malachi was a bachelor. They were the salt
of the earth and the salt had not lost its savor. Without the
three it would have been difficult for some of the neighbors,
including my mother, to keep house. Malachi repaired the
leaks in the roof, eased the doors, mended the chairs and kept
the house generally in running order. Uncle Eben did the
chores, fed and scratched the pig, sawed, split and piled the
wood and wheeled our corn to the mill, taking care that Sylvanus
Maxim, the miller, did not take out too much toll. In
those days, every family bought or raised its own corn and
sent it to the mill to be ground. When the steamboat arrived,
if one happened to be running, Eben was always on the wharf
with his handcart ready to take the luggage of passengers to
their homes. I can see the old man now scraping with his jackknife
the apples I occasionally gave him, which, with his loss
of teeth, he could neither bite nor chew. He died January 6,
1851, at the age of 77 years.</p>

<p>But chief of “the blessed three” was Aunt Debby. She assisted
in making soap and candles, would nurse the sick, diagnose
the various diseases of children, such as measles, by their
smell, administer picra and “yarb” tea, staunch the blood of a
cut finger with cobwebs and with the buds of the balsam poplar,
or balm of Gilead, heal the wound. She was the forerunner,
too, of those who with no more accuracy than she exhibited,
foretell the number of a winter’s snow storms. In my college
vacation my first visit was always to her, and at Thanksgiving
time it was often my privilege to bear a turkey and a couple
of pies to her scanty board. She died April 15, 1844, at the
age of 72. Peace to her ashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The easterly part of the house was occupied by William
Collingwood, a worthy and intelligent Englishman, the father
of our respected townsmen, George and James Bartlett Collingwood.
He had been a manufacturer of pottery in Sunderland,
in the shire of Durham, but owing to reverses he was
induced to come to America, and took passage in 1819 with
Capt. Plasket of Nantucket, bringing with him his wife Eleanor
(Harrow) Collingwood and two sons, George and William,
one year old. He settled in Nantucket, the home of Capt.
Plasket, where he remained until 1825, when James Bartlett,
who, with others, owned two ships in the whale fishery, induced
him to come to Plymouth and take charge of the oil and
candle works then recently established, which were situated
between the house of the late Jesse R. Atwood and the shore.
As long as the works remained in operation he was at their
head, and afterwards for a time kept a restaurant at the corner
of North and Water streets. He died in Plymouth in 1866,
at the age of 76, and his wife died in 1884, at the age of 90.
Three of Mr. Collingwood’s sons died in the civil war. Joseph
W., born in Nantucket January 5, 1822, was captain in Company
H, 18th Massachusetts regiment, and died in a field hospital
December 24, 1862, of wounds received at the battle of
Fredericksburg on the 13th of that month. John B., born
December 30, 1825, was adjutant of the 29th Massachusetts
regiment and died in St. John’s Hospital in Cincinnati, August
21, 1863. Thomas, born November 10, 1831, was a corporal
in Company E, 29th Massachusetts regiment, and died at Camp
Banks, Crab Orchard, Ky., August 31, 1863.</p>

<p>In 1843 Mrs. Collingwood was summoned to England to
secure by identification an inheritance of property. She had
then reached middle life, but, nevertheless, without a companion
or attendant, she sailed on the 1st of July in the above
year in the Cunard steamer Columbia, from Boston for Halifax
and Liverpool. The Columbia, like all the earliest boats
of the Cunard line, was a paddle wheel boat of about 1,200
tons. I know very well what those boats were, for I made a
passage in the Hibernia of the same line in March, 1847, and
I often wonder that in such small crafts, with one wheel buried
in every roll of the sea, passengers were willing to expose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
themselves to the hazards of a winter passage. On Sunday,
the second day out, when 240 miles from Boston, while still
in charge of the pilot who, in accordance with the custom prevailing
while the steamers called at Halifax, remained on
board, the Columbia, in a thick fog, having been carried out of
her course by an unusual Bay of Fundy current, struck a
sloping rock on Black Ledge about a mile and a quarter from
Seal Island, and 25 miles from Barrington, Nova Scotia, the
nearest port on the mainland. Fortunately the sea was smooth
and when the fog lifted a fishing schooner nearby came to the
ship and with the boats of the steamer transferred to the island
the passengers, 95 in number, including those in the steerage,
and 73 officers and men, with luggage and the mails. The
cargo was eventually saved, but the ship was a total loss.
While on the island a sort of colonial government was established
with Mr. Abbot Lawrence of Boston, one of the passengers
at its head, to prevent excesses and possible disturbance,
and a passing vessel was sent to Halifax with news of
the wreck. In due time the steamer Margaret took them to
that port, most of the passengers and crew continuing their
passage in her to Liverpool. For the kindness and attention
shown to Mrs. Collingwood by Mr. Lawrence she was always
grateful. The valet of Mr. Lawrence was James Burr, a colored
boy from Plymouth, who often with pride recounted to
me the story of his adventure.</p>

<p>It is a little singular that our townsman, Robert Swinburn,
recently deceased at an advanced age, came to Plymouth when
a young man from Sunderland, the town in which Mr. Collingwood
lived, and where he also was engaged in the employment
of a potter, and should twenty years later than the
voyage of Mrs. Collingwood have been also summoned to
England for the purpose of obtaining an inheritance. A circumstance
connected with the loss of the Columbia, which reminds
us of the changes which have occurred in the facilities
of communication, is the fact that the news of the wreck,
which occurred on Sunday, the 2d of July, did not reach Boston
until Sunday, the 9th.</p>

<p>I have given the loss of the Columbia a prominence in these
memories because it was the only loss which the Cunard company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
has suffered during its career of 64 years, except that of
the Oregon, a steamer sold to the company by another line
after a collision and a transfer of her passengers to another
vessel, which foundered near Fire Island. Two other ocean
steamers had been previously lost, the President, with all on
board, in 1841, and the West India packet steamer Solway,
off Corunna, in April, 1843, with her captain and fifty lives.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression to North street, from which
I have wandered long and far, I wish to correct a statement,
based on misinformation, made by me in “Ancient Landmarks
of Plymouth,” that the Willoughby house, built by Edward
Winslow in 1755, was confiscated. Mr. Winslow held the
office of collector of the port of Plymouth, registrar of wills
and clerk of the superior court of common pleas, and the
salaries from these offices, though he was not a rich man,
enabled him to live in luxury and ease. He was generous to
the poor and lavish in his entertainment of families in the aristocratic
circles. He was a loyalist of the most pronounced
type, and consequently lost his offices at the breaking out of
the revolution. As nearly as I can learn from family records
he remained in Plymouth several years, evidently assisted by
friends, some of whom in a quiet way shared his loyalty to the
king. In December, 1781, he reached the British garrison in
New York with a part of his family, the remainder joining
him at a later period. Sir Henry Clinton allowed him a pension
of £200 per annum, with rations and fuel. On the 30th
of August, 1783, he embarked with his wife, two daughters
and three colored servants from New York and arrived at
Halifax on the 14th of September. He died in Halifax the
next year, 70 years of age. The house in question was taken
on execution by his creditors, consisting of the town of Plymouth,
Thomas Davis, William Thomas, Oakes Angier and
John Rowe, and in 1782, 1789, 1790 and 1791 it was sold by
the above parties to Thomas Jackson. In 1813 it passed under
an execution from Thomas Jackson to his cousin, Charles
Jackson, the father of the late Dr. Charles T. Jackson and Mrs.
Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>Edward Winslow, son of the above, graduated in Harvard
in 1765, and at the time of the revolution was naval officer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the port of Plymouth and held the offices of clerk of the court
and register of probate jointly with his father. He joined the
British army in Boston and went with Lord Percy on his
disastrous expedition to Lexington and Concord, and was later
appointed by Gen. Gage collector of Boston and register of
probate for Suffolk county. At the evacuation of Boston,
March 17, 1776, he went with the army to Halifax, where he
was made by Sir William Howe secretary of the board of general
officers, of which Lord Percy was president, for the distribution
of donations to the troops. He afterwards went to
New York and was appointed muster master general of the
forces, and acted in that capacity during the war. In 1779 he
was chosen by refugees in Rhode Island to command them,
and served during two campaigns. After the war he was military
secretary until the death of his father, and in 1785 went
to New Brunswick, where he held the positions of king’s counsellor
and paymaster of contingencies, and died in 1815.</p>

<p>In the Winslow house above referred to Ralph Waldo
Emerson married, August 22, 1835, Lydia Jackson, daughter
of Charles and Lucy (Cotton) Jackson. I have a distinct
recollection of the first time I ever saw Mr. Emerson, and I
have no doubt that it was the first time he ever visited Plymouth.
It was, I feel sure, in 1833, soon after he left the pulpit
of the Second Unitarian church in Boston and after he had
begun his career as a lecturer. It is said that his first lecture
was delivered before the Boston Mechanics Institute on the
very practical subject of “Water.” At the time referred to
he lectured in Pilgrim Hall on Socrates, and was the guest of
Nathaniel Russell, whose daughter, Mary Howland Russell,
born in 1803, was an intimate friend of Lydia Jackson, born in
1802. I believe that I am justified in assuming that on that
visit he first saw his future wife. I remember well his appearance
and manners on the lecture platform, and as a boy of
eleven years I thought him oracular and dull. In the same
year the wandering piper with his kilt and bagpipe appeared
also in Pilgrim Hall, and Potter, the ventriloquist, entertained
audiences by swallowing swords, and I am almost afraid to
say that the exhibitions gave me more pleasure than the lecture.
But my eyes had not at that early age been opened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Dr. Holmes once asked an English gentleman to whom he had
just been introduced, how he liked America, and on receiving
the reply that he had been in the country only nine days, told
him that a pup required only nine days to open its eyes. But
the doctor never hesitated to sacrifice courtesy for the sake of
a joke, as the following story will further show: Hearing one
evening at a party the name of a gentleman present, whom he
had never seen before, he asked him if he were a relative of
an apothecary of that name, and on receiving the answer that
he was his son, he told him that he thought he recognized in
his face the “liniments” of his father. But to return to Mr.
Emerson, my eyes have been opened.</p>

<p>In concluding the changes which have occurred in North
street within my recollection, it only remains to be said that
the Manter building on the corner of Water street was removed
in 1859 from Pilgrim wharf, and stands on land formerly
occupied by a tenement house, and by a small one-story
building occupied by Thomas Maglathlen.</p>

<p>Water street, including its extension, was laid out by various
acts of the town, as follows: On the 16th of February,
1715, in 1762, on the 4th of April, 1881, the 9th of December,
1893, and the 22d of June, 1895. The changes on the
extension of the street, caused by the erection of the woolen
mill of Mr. Mabbett, the utilization of the old Jackson lumber
yard by Mr. Craig and the erection of the Brockton and Plymouth
trolley electric plant, have been so recent that no reference
to them is necessary. With the exception of the foundry,
which was built to take the place of the foundry burned
in 1856, and the electric light building on the corner of Leyden
street, no new structure has changed in my day the general
character of the street.</p>

<p>In my youth, and later, there were eight buildings on the
westerly side of the street between North street and the steps
at the foot of Middle street. In the rear of these houses
there were two terraces supported by stone walls, and some
of the houses were entered by flights of steps leading down
from the top of the hill. In 1856, and in the years immediately
succeeding, the Pilgrim Society bought all these estates,
and after the removal of the houses graded the slope as it is
seen today. The granite steps from the surface of the hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to the canopy over the Rock was built by private subscription.
The graded bank is the property of the Pilgrim Society, and
the surface of the hill, which belongs to the town, was placed
by a vote of the town under the superintendence and care of
the society.</p>

<p>Until recently there were also eight buildings between the
way leading to the Middle street steps and the grass bank
on Leyden street. By the will of J. Henry Stickney of Baltimore,
who died May 3, 1893, the sum of $21,000 was given
to a board of trustees for the purpose of buying and removing
these houses and grading the bank. The board of trustees
consists of the chairman of the selectmen, the presidents
of the two national banks, the president and secretary of the
Pilgrim Society, the president of the Plymouth Savings Bank,
and the judge of probate and treasurer of Plymouth county,
and their successors in said offices. All the estates have
been bought except that owned by Winslow Brewster Standish,
and the grading as far as practicable has been done.</p>

<p>The only remaining change in the street to be referred to is
that associated with Pilgrim wharf and the Rock. Until 1859
the wharf was devoted to commercial uses. In that year the
upper part of the wharf came into the possession of the Pilgrim
Society, and the building which had stood on the northerly
corner of the wharf was moved to the corner of Water
and North streets, and eventually came into the possession of
Mr. Manter, its present occupant.</p>

<p>Two buildings on the south side, between the wharf and
the store of Mr. Atwood, were also bought by the society and
removed. That on the corner had for many years been occupied
in its lower story by a cooper shop and in its upper story
by the sail loft of Daniel Goddard, and the other had been occupied
as a store successively by Richard Holmes, Holmes &amp;
Scudder, Holmes &amp; Brewster and John Churchill.</p>

<p>In 1883 the Pilgrim Society bought the entire wharf, and
after removing the store houses standing on it fitted it for
a steamboat landing exclusively. The corner stone of the
canopy over the Rock was laid on the 2d of August, 1859, and
the structure was completed in 1867. It was designed by
Hammatt Billings, but follows very closely the plan of the
Arch of Trajan built on one of the moles of the harbor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Ancona on the shores of the Adriatic. The use of scallop
shells on its top was suggested by the fact that this shell was
the emblem worn by the Pilgrims on their way to the Holy
Land. The word Pilgrim, as applied to the Plymouth colonists,
was never used, as far as I can learn, for more than a
hundred and seventy years after the landing. They were
called “first-comers” and “forefathers” until 1794, when Judge
John Davis, in his ode written for the anniversary celebration
in that year first used the word “Pilgrim” in the following
verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Columbia, child of heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The best of blessings given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be thine to greet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hailing this votive day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking with fond survey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the weary way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of Pilgrim feet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next use of the word was made by Samuel Davis in a
hymn written by him for the celebration in 1799, the first
verse of which is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hail Pilgrim fathers of our race!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With grateful hearts your toils we trace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Again this votive day returns</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And finds us bending o’er your urns.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The word was undoubtedly suggested to Judge Davis by
a casual remark of Governor Bradford in his history of
Plymouth Plantation expressing the regret of the colonists at
leaving Leyden, as follows: “But they knew they were Pilgrims,
and looked not much on those things but lifted up their
eyes to the heavens, their dearest country, and so quieted their
spirits.” The first use of the scallop shell associated with
the Plymouth Pilgrims was at the anniversary celebration in
1820, when at the ball in the evening some young ladies hung
a shell suitably decorated on the breast of Mr. Webster, the
orator of the day. It simply expresses the sentiment that
man is a wayfarer travelling toward another and a better world.
I have seen it somewhere stated that it was worn by the Pilgrims
returning from the Holy Land, and if such is the case as
the scallop is abundant on the shores of the Mediterranean, it
may have been adopted to attest their pilgrimage. In the
chamber of the canopy are deposited four skeletons of Pilgrims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
buried in the winter of 1620-1 on Cole’s Hill, which were discovered
in 1854 by workmen digging a trench for laying water
pipes in Carver street, a little south of the foot of Middle
street.</p>

<p>Before concluding what I have to say concerning Water
street with its business, its stores and their occupants, I wish
to refer more particularly to Plymouth Rock and its history,
to supply necessary links in the chain of my narrative. Its
first public recognition as the landing place of the Pilgrims occurred
in 1742, after a grant had been made to individuals by
the town of a strip of land extending from the top of Cole’s
Hill to low water mark, for the purpose of building a wharf.
Thomas Faunce, the third elder of the Plymouth church, born
in 1647, was ten years old when Governor Bradford died in
1657, twenty-six years old when John Howland died in
1673, thirty-three years old when George Soule died in
1680, and forty years old when John Alden died in 1687, all of
whom were Mayflower’s passengers. Hearing of the proposed
wharf, and believing that the Rock would be buried
from sight, he gathered on the spot his children and grandchildren
and told them the story of the landing, which he had
received from the Pilgrims themselves. Dr. James Thacher
was told of this incident by witnesses of the scene, and
through the channel of his history of Plymouth, the authenticity
of the Rock has become a matter of historic record.</p>

<p>The second recognition of the Rock as the place of the
landing, occurred in 1774, when the inhabitants of Plymouth
under the lead of Col. Theopilus Cotton assembled about it
with about twenty yoke of oxen, with the view of removing it
to Liberty Pole square, as they called Town square, and consecrating
it to the shrine of liberty. In attempting to raise
it it separated into two parts, one of which was permitted to
remain and the other was carried to its destination. There
it remained until 1834, resting against the lower elm tree on
the southerly side of the square. In that year the fourth of
July was celebrated by its removal to the front yard of Pilgrim
hall. A procession, of which Capt. Samuel Doten was
marshal, preceded by the school children of the town, escorted
a decorated truck bearing the Rock, then weighing 6,997
pounds, which was followed by a model of the Mayflower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
mounted on a car and drawn by six boys, of whom I was one.
The Plymouth Band and the Standish Guards performed escort
duty, and on reaching Pilgrim hall an address was delivered
by Dr. Chas. Cotton, and a prayer was made by Rev. Dr.
James Kendall. The ceremonies of the day closed with a dinner
served in the basement of the hall by Danville Bryant,
proprietor of the Pilgrim House, at which Hon. Nathaniel
M. Davis presided, assisted by Hon. Isaac L. Hedge, Abraham
Jackson, John Bartlett 3d, Nathaniel Wood and Eliab Ward
as vice presidents. In June of the next year the Rock, in its
new place, was inclosed by an iron fence designed by George
W. Brimmer of Boston, the designer of the Gothic meeting
house of the Unitarian parish, and so remained until 1880,
when it was removed without display and placed within the
canopy on that part of the Rock from which it was separated
one hundred and six years before. The iron fence has since
that time served to inclose a granite memorial in front of Pilgrim
Hall bearing on its face the text of the Pilgrim compact.</p>

<p>As far back as I can recall, in 1832, Water street retained
much of the business aspect, which had characterized it for
about seventy-five years. The whaling and fishing industries
were active and prosperous and Boston had not yet drawn
away from Plymouth any considerable portion of its foreign
trade. Molasses and sugar from the West India Islands, salt
from Turks Island and Cadiz, and iron from Gothenberg, continued
to come in, the last free of that burdensome duty, which
has destroyed the iron industries of the old colony. I can hear
today the rattling of the bars which Stephen Thomas and
others carted through our streets to the various manufactories
established in Plymouth, Carver, Wareham, Plympton
and Kingston. I can count within my memory twenty-six establishments
engaged in the manufacture of iron in Plymouth
county, while with only two or three exceptions the few now
at work are in a languishing condition. I have letters in my
possession written in Plymouth, opposing the imposition of
high duties, and predicting as a result of their operation the
very conditions which now exist.</p>

</div>


<p>Living as I did on Cole’s Hill through my youth, I have a
distinct recollection of Water street and its business as far
back as 1832. During the summer I spent much of my time
out of school hours sculling a boat, or climbing vessels’ rigging.
At those times my special playmate was Winslow
Whiting, who during the last years of his seafaring life commanded
the bark Volant, and when the brig Hannah was in
her berth on the north side of Hedge’s wharf we laughed at
the boys crawling through the lubber hole, while we proudly
mounted the futtock shrouds.</p>

<p>At that time there were on Water street fourteen stores,
three counting rooms, two blacksmith shops, two pump and
blockmakers’ shops, two painters’ shops, one sail loft, one rigging
loft, perhaps six cooper shops, one carpenter’s shop, a
wood carver’s loft, and on the eight wharves leading from the
street, sixteen storehouses. The stores were occupied by
James Spooner, I. L. and T. Hedge, Richard Holmes, George
Cooper, Elkanah Bartlett, William Nye, Josiah Robbins, Atwood
L. Drew, Charles Bramhall, Phineas Wells, Levi Barnes,
Scudder and Churchill, Leander Lovell and Henry Tillson.</p>

<p>James Spooner was the son of Deacon Ephraim Spooner,
and lived all his life in the house on North street, now occupied
by the widow of his grandson, James Walter Spooner.
He occupied a store in the building still standing at the head
of what is called Long Wharf. He owned several schooners
engaged in the Grand Bank fishery, among which were the
Swallow, Seneca and Leo. In the last named I was, though a
boy, permitted to launch, and she was commanded for a time
by the late Peter W. Smith. The Swallow had been a fisherman
ever since 1803, but, nevertheless, continued in active
business until 1873, when she was lost. Mr. Spooner died,
March 5, 1838. He was succeeded in the store by William
Churchill, a native of Duxbury, and the son of Peleg Churchill,
whose daughter, Eliza, married Joseph Chandler, the father
of the late Peleg Churchill Chandler of Plymouth, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
named after his grandfather. Mr. Churchill built and occupied
for several years the house on Middle street, now occupied
by Charles H. Frink. While in Plymouth he carried on
the mackerel fishery, employing as packers and coopers, his
brother, Otis Churchill, and Winslow Cole. He removed in
1838 to Boston, where on Long Wharf he continued the same
business.</p>

<p>The store of I. L. and T. Hedge, occupied the easterly half
of the building which stood on the northerly corner of Hedge’s
wharf. With James Bartlett they were largely engaged in
the whale fishery, having their counting room upstairs, and
their store room below. Mr. Isaac L. Hedge moved in that
year, 1832, into the house built by him, now owned and occupied
by Father Buckley, where he died, April 19, 1867; Mr.
Thomas Hedge was living in the house now owned by his
daughter, Mrs. Lothrop, which he had bought off Thomas
Jackson in 1830, and where he died, July 11, 1865.</p>

<p>John Thomas, who as a lawyer, occupied an office connected
with the Hayward house on Main street, where the engine
house now stands, was admitted to the firm in 1832, but in
1837 he removed to New York, where he engaged successfully
in the wholesale iron business, and accumulated a handsome
property. When retiring from business he bought an
estate at Irvington on the North river, and built a house
which he occupied until his death. He was killed by lightning
in the hay field in July, 1855. He was the father of the late
Wm. A. Thomas of Kingston.</p>

<p>Richard Holmes occupied a store standing immediately
north of the present market of Anthony Atwood. He was a
member of one of the oldest Plymouth families, and lived
until 1835 in the house on Cole’s Hill, now occupied by Anthony
Atwood. In that year he bought a lot of land immediately
north of the house of Mrs. Lothrop, extending from
Court street to the shore, and built a house with fish houses
and fish flakes in its rear, where he lived until his death. In
1833, his son-in-law, Alonzo D. Scudder, became his partner
in business, and, after his death, July 4, 1841, continued with
his son, Richard W. Holmes. After the death of Mr. Scudder,
April 5, 1853, Isaac Brewster became the partner of
Richard W. Holmes, after whose death, February 15, 1862,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the store was occupied by John Churchill. Holmes &amp; Scudder
and Holmes &amp; Brewster were many years engaged in
the Grand Bank fishery, and general navigation, and their
skippers, among whom were Oliver C. Vaughn, Benjamin
Jenkins and William Atwood, regardless of equinoctial storms
remained on the Banks until they had wet their salt. They
owned at various times the schooners Volant, Flash, Abeona,
Medium, Seadrift, Swallow, Challenge, Flora, Anna Hincks
and Palestine, all of which, except the last two, were engaged
in the Grand Bank fishery.</p>

<p>The next building at the head of Davis wharf contained for
many years prior to 1826 the counting room of my grandfather,
William Davis, who died, January 5, in that year.
After a short occupation by William Spooner, it was in 1832
occupied as a store by George Cooper. For several years before
that date, and many years after 1833, Mr. Cooper was employed
as a clerk, and as far as I know, was never concerned
in navigation. His occupation of the store was short, and he
was succeeded by Elisha Whiting and Bartlett Holmes, Jr.,
and William Davis Simmons and others, until it came into
the possession of Jesse R. Atwood, whose son, Anthony Atwood,
now occupies it for a fish market. Mr. Cooper died
April 29, 1864.</p>

<p>Elkanah Bartlett kept a store at the northerly corner of Carver’s,
now Craig’s wharf, until his death. John Darling
Churchill was connected as clerk, and in other ways with Mr.
Bartlett, for many years, and succeeded him in business. Mr.
Churchill, like Mr. Bartlett, was engaged in the Grand Bank
fishery, and with Nathaniel E. Harlow, owned the schooners
Conanchet, Engineer, Oronoco and Wampatuck.</p>

<p>William Nye had a store a little back from the street between
Carver’s wharf and Barnes’ wharf, where he bought
and sold old iron and junk. My associations with his store
are among the pleasantest of my youth, for there by the sale
of old iron, which I most assiduously picked up for two or
three weeks before that holiday which was so delightful to
all boys, the old election day, I found the wherewithal for the
holiday feast, which was held in the barn or carriage house
of some one of our families, and consisted of election cake
and lobster and lemonade in the morning, followed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
stomach ache in the afternoon. The town baker always made
up a good batch of election cake or buns, for the occasion, and
these articles formed as important a part in the diet of the
day as succotash on Forefathers’ day. Mr. Nye would gather
for his business at election time, a bag of bright new cents,
and would tempt the æsthetic taste of the boys by asking them
if they would take one bright cent or two dull ones. No day,
not even Thanksgiving day, has such a firm seat in my memory
as the old election day. It was the day of the meeting of
the General Court, which until 1832, occurred on the third
Wednesday in May. Mr. Nye lived in a house at the southerly
end of Water street, which stood on the site of the house
built and occupied by the late Rufus Churchill, who married
one of his daughters. Mr. Nye came to Plymouth from Sandwich,
and died February 25, 1849, and after his death, his
house was moved across the street, where it now stands.</p>

<p>Alonzo D. Scudder, who came to Plymouth from Barnstable,
began business in Water street with Lemuel B. Churchill
for the sale of grain and flour, but precisely where their store
was I cannot say. The partnership continued only a short
time, and in 1833 Mr. Scudder became a partner with his
father-in-law, Richard Holmes. He died as already stated,
April 5, 1853, and Mr. Churchill died December 30, 1833.</p>

<p>Atwood L. Drew, I think, occupied a store, in 1832, in the
basement of his father’s house, near the corner of Leyden
street, and was quite extensively engaged at various times in
the whale and Grand Bank fisheries, and in general navigation.
In 1839 he was associated as a partner with Leander
Lovell, and built the store now standing at the northerly
corner of Barnes’ wharf. In later life he was associated in
some capacity with his brother, William Rider Drew, an enterprising
and prosperous manufacturer, who is still living,
and whose extensive establishment for the manufacture of
tacks and rivets is situated on Smelt Brook at Rocky Nook.
Mr. Drew died November 25, 1877.</p>

<p>The store kept by Levi Barnes as early as 1830 was one of
two in the building which stood on the southerly corner of
the way leading to Middle street. In the latter part of his
life he occupied the store which had been occupied by Phineas
Wells. He died May 14, 1853, in the house on North street
which he had owned and occupied since 1835.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Chas. Bramhall, who occupied the northerly store in the
building above mentioned, was the son of Benjamin Bramhall,
and one of a family of enterprising sons, five of whom
I knew. His brother William was a prosperous merchant in
Boston, and for many years President of the Shawmut Bank,
a position now occupied by our summer townsman, Jas. P.
Stearns, his son-in-law. Mr. Bramhall was actively engaged
in the Grand Bank fishery, and died May 29, 1859, in the
house where he had lived many years, recently occupied by B.
O. Strong.</p>

<p>Henry Tillson was a son of Hamblin Tillson, and kept a
shoe store on Water street, as early as 1828, and in 1832 removed
to Market street, and died December 27, 1834.</p>

<p>Leander Lovell’s store on Water street I cannot locate, but
he was there as early as 1827, and on the tenth of November
in that year his store was entered by burglars. In 1839 he was
associated in business with Atwood L. Drew, and in the later
years of his life was a partner with J. H. Harlow in the dry
goods business in the store on Main street, now occupied by
H. H. Cole. He was Town Clerk from 1852 to 1878, and as
chairman of the Board of Selectmen and Moderator for many
years, I am glad to put on record my appreciation of his
courtesy and fidelity in the performance of his municipal duties.
He came to Plymouth from Barnstable and married a
daughter of Capt. James Bartlett, and died October 1, 1879.</p>

<p>Phineas Wells came to Plymouth from Maine, and married
in 1828 Mercy, daughter of George Ellis. He opened in 1827
a grocery store which occupied the whole front of the building
opposite the head of Hedge’s wharf. He was a master of
his business, prudent, methodical and industrious, and so far
as salesroom and storeroom were concerned, his store has never
been surpassed in Plymouth. In or about 1850 he moved
across the street and fitted up a store on the northerly corner
of Hedge’s wharf, where he remained until 1859, when he
again moved to the store at the junction of Water and Leyden
streets, where he remained until his death, December 8, 1869.</p>

<p>Josiah Robbins occupied a store at the head of Robbins’
wharf. In looking over the files of the <span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span>
to verify my recollection of Water street, I find that he
was there as early as 1827, and in that year advertised the sale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of old currant wine. The temperance movement began in the
above year, and I think in the sale of wines the lines must have
been drawn at the product of currants, as the following officers
of the Temperance Society organized in 1827 were
chosen: Nathaniel Russell, President; Zabdiel Sampson, Vice-President;
Wm. Thomas, Secretary; and Ichabod Morton,
Nathan Hayward, Jacob Covington, Josiah Robbins, Thomas
Atwood, John Russell, Thomas Russell and Isaac L. Hedge,
Executive Committee. It is probable that up to that time
every grocery store contained ardent spirits in its stock, and
on the 8th of September, 1827, I. &amp; E. Morton, whose senior
partner was one of the above executive committee, advertised
concerning their store at Wellingsley that “that prolific
mother of miseries, that giant foe to human happiness, shall
no longer have a dwelling place under our roof.” The
movement was followed up by temperance lectures delivered
in the church at Training Green by Mr. Daniel Frost, and
total abstinence pledges were signed by nearly one quarter
of the entire population of the town. Though the grocers as
a body abandoned the sale of spirits, obedience to popular
sentiment was by no means universal. Family use and individual
consumption were largely diminished, and with the
erection in 1835 of the frame of the double house on the corner
of Howland street, the practice of using liquor at “raisings”
ceased. In the ship yards, however, for some years after that
date, work was regularly knocked off every day at eleven and
four o’clock for the distribution among the men of New England
rum. Public opinion, however, without its re-inforcement
by law, finally prevailed, and I should say that from
1835 to 1840 it would have been impossible to buy either
ardent spirits or wines, except at the hotels, and that there
were less than a dozen houses in which they could be found.
I am inclined to think that even under the operation of stringent
laws there has been a reaction, and that they are now
more generally, though not excessively used than they were
sixty-five years ago. It cannot, however, be denied, that if
total abstinence less widely prevails, intemperance is less common,
and more severely condemned. May it not be true that
public opinion is more potent than law?</p>

<p>I have said that in 1832 there were three counting houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
on Water street, meaning such as were engaged in the business
of foreign navigation. These were D. &amp; A. Jackson,
Nelson &amp; Harlow, and Nathaniel Carver. The oldest and
most important was that of D. &amp; A. Jackson, which derived
both its business and character from the old firm of Daniel
and Charles Jackson, father and uncle of the members of the
house. It did not immediately follow in chronological order
the old house of Daniel and Charles Jackson, as for a time
after the death of Charles Jackson in 1818 Daniel, the surviving
partner, formed a partnership with his son Jacob, under
the firm name of Daniel Jackson and son, which was dissolved
in 1828. In this last year the firm of D. &amp; A. Jackson
had its origin. Though as far as the public knew only
Daniel and Abraham were members of the firm, that at a later
date their younger brother, Isaac Carver Jackson, became associated
with them, there can be no doubt. It is within my
recollection that the ship Iconium, the last ship built by the
firm, was built in 1848 or thereabouts on the Sheepscott river,
under Mr. Isaac C. Jackson’s exclusive supervision.</p>

<p>The Jackson brothers were a remarkable set of men, six in
number, all about six feet in height, gentlemen in bearing and
dress, and with their blue coats and brass buttons, and in
summer, white beaver hats, white trousers, low shoes and white
stockings, their appearance in our streets gave character and
expression to the town. They were all confident, self-centered
men, who knew what they wanted and how to accomplish it,
meddling in no man’s business and permitting no man to meddle
in theirs; neither asking for nor offering advice. They had
means sufficient to carry out their enterprises and never sought
outside of their family and their commanders, the contribution
of a timber head to their ships.</p>

<p>The first vessels built by D. &amp; A. Jackson were the Echo
and Arno fishing vessels, which were sold. The Arno was
probably the vessel of that name, which was many years one
of the Plymouth fishing fleet. They next built a topsail
schooner named the Janus, which made one voyage under command
of Capt. Daniel Jackson to Russia, and was sold. In
1829 they built the brig Janus, commanded by Capt. William
Holmes, who died in Valparaiso, May 10, 1831, while in command.
They next built the brig Rhine of which Capt. Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Robbins was master a number of years, and which was
finally lost on Fire Island. The brigs Maze and Autumn
followed, engaged in general freighting business, and the brig
Ganges commanded by Capt. Phineas Leach, and also the
brig Cyclops. All of these vessels, including others up to perhaps
1835, were built in what was afterwards known as Battles’
lumber yard. The brig Eurotas, one of the Jackson fleet,
was bought in Duxbury and placed in command of Capt.
Eleazer Stevens Turner, which he commanded until he took
command of the ship Thracian, when he was succeeded in
the Eurotas by Capt. Ira Potter.</p>

<p>How well I remember those bright waisted brigs, graceful
and weatherly, and especially the Cyclops with her figurehead
representing the mythological giant with a single eye in the
middle of his forehead.</p>

<p>This head was doubtless the work of Samuel W. Gleason,
who came to Plymouth from Middleboro and exhibited much
talent as a wood carver. Two of his sons continued in business
in Plymouth as long as ship building was active in
Plymouth and Duxbury and Kingston, when they removed to
Boston, and achieved some very commendable work on the
clipper ships of the California and Australian period.</p>

<p>The Jackson firm were not long content with the building
of brigs. While such vessels were well enough adapted to the
iron trade, they were unsuited to the carrying of sugar from
the West Indies to the North of Europe, and still more unsuited
to the transportation of cotton. It was not an uncommon
thing for vessels in the sugar trade bound from Havana
to Cronstadt, to put into Plymouth to take out a clean bill of
health. I remember well the ship Harvest, Capt. Lawton with
George Warren supercargo, belonging to Barnabas Hedge,
anchoring in Saquish cove, and proceeding with a new bill of
health. The complete abandonment of the brig was effected
when, at a later period, coal transportation became extensive
on the Delaware and other rivers. The last full rigged brig
in Plymouth was the old brig Hannah, which was owned by
Barnabas Hedge, and commanded many years by Capt. Isaac
Bartlett in the West India trade. Her last service was on a
fishing trip to the straits, commanded by Capt. Ignatius Pierce,
the father of the late Capts. Ignatius and Ebenezer Pierce.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
The last American brig ever seen by me was in Salem harbor
about thirty years ago, engaged in the African trade.</p>

<p>The ships Thracian and Persian were built in a yard about
where the foot of Brewster street now is, by James Collins,
master carpenter, who had already built the ships Brenda and
Dromo for Arthur French of Boston, a brother-in-law of
Abraham Jackson. The Jackson fleet of ships was completed
by the purchase in Maine of the Tyrian and the building of
the Iconium. Of each of these ships I have something to say.
Many a trenail turned out by me in a trenail machine on a
Saturday afternoon was put into the bottoms of the Thracian
and Persian, and many a cracker and slice of cheese have I
eaten in the ship house at their launchings. Capt. Frederick
Robbins was transferred from the brig Rhine to the Persian,
Capt. Eleazer Stevens Turner from the brig Eurotas to the
Thracian, and Capt. Daniel Lothrop Jackson, son of the senior
partner of the house, was given the command of the Tyrian.</p>

<p>Capt. Turner was eventually transferred to the Iconium,
on which ship he was finally succeeded by Capt. William
Davie. These ships were first class ships in every particular,
and for one or each of them the schooner Capitol was bought
in Maine and placed in command of Capt. Richard Rogers,
who was sent to Virginia with wood choppers, teams and provisions
and a gang of carpenters under Benjamin Bagnall, to
get out frames on a tract of timber land, which the Jacksons
had bought or leased for the purpose.</p>

<p>In December, 1846, I was in Marseilles waiting for a steamer
to take me to Genoa and Naples. Having been in Paris
away from the sea six months or more, I have never before
or since experienced the pleasure which a sight of the Mediterranean
gave me. My first excursion from the hotel, after
my arrival, was as it would have been at home—down among
the shipping. The new harbor had not then been opened, and
the ships were made fast with their sterns to the mole. Seeing
an American flag at one mast head, I soon read on the stern of
the ship, “Persian of Plymouth.” Inquiring of the ship keeper
if Capt. Robbins, whom I knew was the captain, was on board,
and learning that he was not, I walked along the mole, looking
into the various stores, and soon saw him astride a chair, club
house fashion, with his arms folded on the back, looking at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
me as I entered. During the three days I was obliged to wait
for my steamer, I spent a half hour each day with him on
board his ship. He was soon to sail for New Orleans, and
as I afterwards learned he died while on the passage, or soon
after his arrival. He was succeeded by Capt. Thomas Appling,
who had commanded the Cyclops, who died at sea of
yellow fever, and was succeeded by Capt. Lewis Robbins.
After leaving Capt. Robbins I walked farther down the mole
and read on the stern of a bark flying the stars and stripes,
the familiar name, “Griffin of Boston.” I knew Capt. Charles
Blake, her owner and commander, who lived directly opposite
my grandmother’s house in Winthrop place. His vessel was
half yacht, half trader, and sometimes with guests, and sometimes
without. He was a skimmer of the seas, taking comfort
and pleasure, for which his freight list might pay in
whole or in part. While I was at Naples he came over and
anchored his bark directly in front of the hotel where I was
stopping.</p>

<p>But my story of Yankee vessels is not all told. On my way
down the coast of the Mediterranean a fellow passenger on
the steamer, an Englishman named James Buchanan, was
constantly boasting of the superiority of English vessels over
all others. Of course I defended my own, nor was it difficult,
in those days at least, to find fault with the squat sails, short
top gallant masts, clumsy blocks, poorly set up spars, and if at
anchor with sails furled, the untidy bunts which often looked
like bundles of rags on the yards of the Englishmen. As we
came to an anchor one morning in the harbor of Genoa, I
pointed out to Mr. Buchanan a very trig looking bark, anchored
near by, which had a familiar look. “She’s a tidy craft,”
said he, “and she’ll be English, of course.” I knew better,
and calling a boatman, directed him to row to the vessel. As
we rowed round her stern I was not very much surprised to
read, “Truman of Kingston,” in hospitable letters. I had
often seen the Truman, Capt. Doane, as well as her sister ship,
the Cecilian, Capt. Dawes, belonging to Joseph Holmes, and
I spent a pleasant hour with the captain in his cabin before
going ashore for a day’s stroll before leaving for Naples in
the evening. It was singular that the only three American
vessels visited by me in nearly a year’s absence from home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
should have hailed from Plymouth, Kingston and Boston, and
that all should have been commanded by men whom I knew.
Another American vessel not actually visited by me during
my trip to Europe in 1846, but seen under interesting circumstances,
emphasized the environment enveloping me associated
with home. On the second of May in the above year, Capt.
John Eldridge of Yarmouth, Mass., master of the New York
and Liverpool packet ship Liverpool, on which I was a passenger,
sighted a dismasted vessel. She lay ahead of us directly
on our course, and in answer to our hail as we rounded
her stern, we found her to be the bark Espindola of and for
New York from Liverpool, with four hundred steerage passengers,
and commanded by Capt. Barstow of Hanover, Mass.,
fourteen miles distant from my house. Capt. Barstow reported
that while he was in his cabin at eight o’clock on the
morning before, the ship under full sail with a light northerly
wind, without warning, was struck by a whirlwind, and completely
dismasted. She wanted spars and provisions. The
subsequent scenes were full of interest.</p>

<p>Luffing up into the wind and running close hauled about
three miles, while spare spars were got out and lashed outside,
and provisions were got in readiness, we ran back and
layed to to the windward of the wreck. With a picked crew,
under the command of the mate, the life boat was sent off in
a rough sea, the mate holding in his hand a coil of lanyard attached
to a Manila line that would float, fastened to the spars.
When all was ready the lashings of the spars were cut, and
when the boat was near enough the coil was thrown on board
the wreck, and the spars pulled alongside. The mate backing
up to the bark jumped into the chains, when she rolled to
windward, and soon had the supply of meats and other provisions
put on board. Capt. Barstow learning that a Plymouth
man was on board the Liverpool, sent his compliments to
me, and after about three hours’ detention, we were again on
our course. I afterwards saw that the Espindola obtained
more spars from the packet ships, Ashburton and Hottinger,
and reached New York after a passage of forty days.</p>

<p>The Tyrian, commanded by Capt. Daniel Lothrop Jackson,
met an untimely fate. During the Irish famine she loaded
with corn for Glasgow, and after her departure from New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
York no tidings of her were ever received. Of the Iconium
I have a story to tell, as I received it from Capt. Turner’s
own lips on his way from Boston to Plymouth, the day after
his marvelous escape from shipwreck in Boston Bay. It must
have been in the month of March in the early 1850s that he
came round the Cape with a load of cotton for Boston, and
with a strong northeast wind, without rain or snow, he expected
to find his way without trouble into lighthouse channel.
But as the day wore on the wind increased to a gale, while
the weather became so thick that to haul off shore, if possible,
was the only safe course to pursue. With a light cotton ship,
the sagging to leeward made it necessary, as night approached,
to come to an anchor. With both anchors down and a
long scope of cable, Capt. Turner hoped to ride out the
gale. As near as he could judge he lay a mile and
a half northeast and by north of the outer Minot’s Rocks.
The wind veered a little to the southeast, but as it veered it
increased in intensity until about midnight one chain parted.
He then cut away his spars, hoping that with an eased ship
the other cable would stand by. But at daybreak the gale still
increasing, the last cable parted, and the ship drifted, stern
foremost, toward Strawberry Hill. The wind had veered at
this time still more to the south, so that if the bow could be
twisted to the northward and westward, and steerage way be
got on the ship, it might be still possible to enter the harbor.
Capt. Turner managed to set a piece of canvas on the foremast
stump, but it did no good, and the ship continued to
drift stern foremost. At this time the air had cleared, but the
gale had not abated, and as a last resort he carried his kedge
anchor aft, and dropped it over the stern, thinking it barely
possible that it might catch long enough to turn the ship on her
heel and give her steerage way. It worked as he hoped, and
with the wind still veering, and hundreds on the shore awaiting
a final disaster, he crawled along between Hardings and
the breakers and rounded Point Allerton without a fathom to
spare. A station pilot boat lying at anchor in the roads put
a pilot on board, and Capt. Turner, as he told me, went into
his cabin and crying like a child, thanked God for his deliverance.
Not long after this he retired temporarily from the sea
to recruit his enfeebled health, and was succeeded in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Iconium by Capt. William Davie, but in 1861 was commissioned
Sailing Master in the Navy, and while in command of the
storeship Relief, bound to the East Indies, he died at Rio
Janeiro, August 5, 1864. In just appreciation of his seamanship
and skill, the Boston Underwriters made him a present
of five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Daniel Jackson, the senior member of the Jackson house,
died July 1, 1852, Abraham Jackson died February 6, 1859,
and Isaac Carver Jackson May 23, 1875.</p>

<p>Finding it difficult to define the ownership of vessels engaged
in commerce, with which other counting houses on Water
street were at various times within my memory associated,
I shall subjoin a list as accurate as I have been able to make it,
of all vessels except those engaged in the cod fishery hailing
from Plymouth since about the year 1828. Those vessels in
the list engaged in whaling will be referred to more particularly
in a narrative of the whaling industry, while it was carried
on in Plymouth. Those vessels engaged in the cod fishery,
which only occasionally engaged in commercial pursuits,
are not included in the list, but will be spoken of in a separate
chapter. Packets and coasters and smacks are included in the
list, but the packets will be further considered under their own
head.</p>

<p>The four following ships, Granada, Hampden, Massasoit and
Sydney in the above list were managed by Capt. John Russell,
who bought or built them with the aid of contributions from
Sydney Bartlett, William Perkins, William Thomas, Thomas
Davis of Boston, and Thomas Russell of Plymouth. I think
the Massasoit was the only one of the four built in Plymouth,
and she was lost on Point Allerton on her return from a Calcutta
voyage in February, 1843. A Mr. Holbrook of Dorchester,
either passenger or supercargo, was lost. The negro
cook calling himself Professor Steamburg, some years afterwards
opened a barber’s shop in the Danforth building at the
corner of North street, having been attracted here by the name
of the town to which the ship belonged on which he was
wrecked.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the packets and smacks, some of which were
also built in Plymouth, a large majority of the vessels in the
above list were launched in Plymouth yards. There were
building yards in Plymouth as early as the beginning of the
eighteenth century, one of which was at the foot of Middle
street, and another on the site of the electric plant at the foot
of Leyden street. The last must have been a well known and
much used yard, and was situated on the northerly shore of
the Mill pond, which was then an arm or cove of the harbor,
with a broad entrance which was later traversed by the causeway
and bridge existing today. At the beginning of the Revolution
John Peck, a naval constructor, was sent to Plymouth
to design and build two vessels of war, which were named
Belisarius and Mercury, the latter being put in the command
of the noted Capt. Simeon Sampson. It is probable that in
early days, when only vessels of light draft of water were required,
building yards were located on shores in close proximity
to the woods, from which with short hauls building materials
could be obtained. Thus the ship building industries
of the south shore of Massachusetts Bay were established and
continued active until the exigencies of commerce demanded
larger vessels, and the construction of railroads and the transport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
by water rendered it easy to supply with timber the yards
of East Boston and Medford and Newburyport. I have no
conclusive record to guide me, but I am inclined to think that
up to the time of the civil war as many vessels were built in
Plymouth and Kingston and Duxbury, and on the North River
as in all the remainder of New England.</p>

<p>Some indication of the extent of the building of vessels in
Duxbury may be seen in the following record of the industry
in that town from 1826 to 1831, inclusive. In 1826 thirteen
square rigged vessels, and three schooners were built; in 1827,
seven square rigged and one schooner; in 1828, two ships, three
brigs and five schooners; in 1829, two ships, six brigs and two
schooners; in 1830, one ship, two brigs and eight schooners,
and in 1831, four ships, three brigs and eight schooners.</p>

<p>In 1834 Ezra Weston of Duxbury, or King Cæsar, as he was
called, who was reckoned the largest ship owner in the United
States next to Wm. Gray of Salem, built the ship Hope of 800
tons, which I remember seeing anchored in the Cow Yard waiting
to be towed to Boston to be rigged. She was the largest
merchantman ever seen in Boston. In my vacation visits to
my grandmother in Boston, where I was in the habit of rambling
about the wharves, I remember the largest ships of that
time, the Asia, the St. Petersburg and the Akbar, owned by
Daniel C. Bacon and others, and none were larger than 400
tons. After the death of Mr. Weston, which occurred August
15, 1842, ship building in Duxbury practically ceased.</p>

<p>So far as the North River is concerned the building of vessels
was begun as early as 1678, and the first one there built
was launched on the Hanover side of the river, a little above
the present bridge on the Plymouth and Boston road. Up to
1889, according to the record of Dr. L. V. Briggs, ten hundred
and twenty-five vessels had been built, many of which before
the Revolution were owned in England. The largest vessel
was a ship of six hundred and fifty tons, and the classes numbered
one hundred and one sloops, four hundred and eight
schooners, sixty-six brigantines, one hundred and thirty-three
brigs, fifty-three barks and two hundred and eight ships. The
North River industry gradually declined as the demand for
larger vessels than could float in the waters of the river, increased.
The records of the ship building industry of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Merrimac river, and those of Medford and East Boston, show
where the industry went. The industry on the Merrimac
river began at a very early period, it having the advantage of
floating its timber from the northern woods directly to the ship
yards. Before the Revolution, what were called Jew’s Rafts,
were built on the Merrimac for a London Jew named Levi,
bolted and fastened with the equipment of a ship, and sent
across the ocean. In an English newspaper of 1770 it was
announced “that the Newbury,” Capt. Rose, had arrived in the
Thames, a raft of timber in the form of a ship, in twenty-six
days from Newbury, New England.</p>

<p>No record of vessels built before the Revolution exists, but
after the Revolution, up to 1883, about five hundred vessels
were built on the Merrimac, and registered in the Custom
House at Newburyport. The career of John Currier, Jr., of
that city, was a remarkable one. Between 1831 and 1883, he
built ninety-two ships, four barks and one schooner, of which
the largest measured nineteen hundred and forty-five tons,
and the average tonnage of the whole number was nine hundred
and fifty-six.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no available record of the East Boston
and Medford ships, but though the career of Donald McKay
was shorter than that of Mr. Currier, it was more remarkable.
Knowing something of Mr. McKay’s origin and early
life, I may be pardoned for making a special reference to him.
He belonged to a family living in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, my
mother’s native town, and was engaged there in his trade as
ship carpenter. My uncle, Cornelius White, a merchant, and
the American Consul in that town, knowing his ability, advised
him to go to Boston, and provided him with letters to such persons
as he thought would advance his interests. Through
these letters to my uncle, Isaac P. Davis, and William Sturgis,
he at once secured work in the Charlestown Navy Yard. An
entering wedge was enough for a man of genius like him, and
the clipper ships which came one after another from his hands,
soon placed him at the head of his profession in the country.
A few years ago I had an interview in New York with his
youngest brother, Nathaniel White McKay, named after another
of my uncles, with regard to a steamboat for the Boston
and Plymouth line, and I think the steamer Shrewsbury,
which ran one season, was chartered through him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The greatest triumph of Mr. McKay was the ship Great Republic,
built at East Boston, three hundred and twenty-five
feet long, fifty-three feet wide, and thirty-seven feet deep,
with a capacity of four thousand tons. She had four masts,
the after one called the spanker mast of a single spar fore and
aft rigged. Her main yard was one hundred and twenty feet
long, and her suit of sails contained 15,653 yards of canvas.
She was partially burned at her dock in New York, and razeed
to three decks and three masts.</p>

<p>In 1803 the foreign trade of Plymouth was at the height of
its prosperity. In that year it was carried on by seventeen
ships, sixteen brigs and forty schooners, and the duties paid
into the Plymouth Custom House amounted to nearly one
hundred thousand dollars. The above list of vessels shows
how much the trade was reduced during the first quarter of
the last century. This was due to the embargo act passed
Dec. 22, 1807, on the recommendation of President Jefferson,
and later to the war of 1812. The embargo act prohibited the
departure from United States ports of all but foreign armed
vessels with public commissions, or foreign merchant ships in
ballast, or with such cargo only as they might have on board
when notified of the law. All American vessels engaged in
the coasting trade were obliged to give bonds to land their
cargo in the United States. This embargo was repealed by a
law taking effect March 15, 1809, except so far as it related
to France and Great Britain, and their dependencies, and in
regard to them also after the next session of Congress. Of
course such a law struck a severe blow at the trade on which
Plymouth most depended for the support of its people, and at
a town meeting held in August, 1808, a petition to the President
for a suspension of the embargo, was adopted in which
it was stated that “prohibitory laws that subject the citizens to
grevious privations and sufferings, the policy of which is at
least questionable, and the temptations to the violations of
which from the nature of man are almost irresistible, will
gradually undermine the morals of society, and introduce a
laxity of principle and contempt of the laws more to be deplored
than even the useless waste of property.”</p>

<p>The President replied that “he would with great willingness
have executed the wish of the inhabitants of Plymouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
had the Berlin and Milan decrees, and the British orders in
Council, which endangered the safety of neutral ships been repealed,
but while the edicts remain, Congress alone can suspend
the embargo.”</p>

<p>During the fifteen months of the continuance of the embargo,
many of the business men of Plymouth were seriously
crippled, and to some who survived its effects, the war which
followed it, brought absolute ruin. During the war the
wharves were crowded with vessels with their topmasts
housed, and canvas bags, which received the name of Madison
night caps, covered the hounds of their rigging. It is not to
be supposed that yankee shrewdness entirely failed to evade
the watchfulness of government officers, whose duty it was to
prevent departures from port. Some of the vessels were already
loaded with cargoes of fish for the West Indies when the
war embargo began, and those which succeeded in the darkness
of some stormy night in quietly setting up their rigging,
and bending their sails, and getting to sea, found ready markets
for their fish at from fifteen to twenty dollars per quintal.</p>

<p>I will close this chapter with a list of the captains of all
vessels excepting those engaged in the cod fishery, who have
served within my recollection.</p>

<p>To the remaining features of Water street about the year
1830, it is not worth while to devote much space or time. The
two blacksmith shops were conducted by Henry Jackson, with
whom his son, Henry Foster Jackson, was associated, opposite
the head of Davis’s wharf, and by Southworth Shaw and his
son Ichabod at the foot of Leyden street. A twelve-foot way
from Leyden street, in direct continuation to Water street,
separated the Shaw shop on the north from the building, which
David Turner occupied as a pump and blockmaker’s shop on
the south. Thus the blacksmith building, the northerly part
of which was converted into a grocery store, was surrounded by
Water street, Leyden street and the way above mentioned.
There is a photograph in Pilgrim Hall of the above buildings as
they were before the changes were made which resulted in the
present condition of that neighborhood.</p>

<p>These blacksmith shops as I remember them were confined
to vessel and general work, and did not include horse shoeing
in their business. Joshua Standish came to Plymouth from
Middleboro in 1828, and established a blacksmith shop opposite
the jail on what is now South Russell street, and went into the
shoeing business; and there were shops of Lewis Perry near
Bradford street, of Ezekiel Rider at Hobbs Hole, of Caleb Battles
at Bramhall’s corner, and of Isaac and Henry Morton at
Chiltonville. The shop now on Summer street, and one carried
on by Newell Raymond and Job Churchill at the head of
North wharf, were started at a later period.</p>

<p>Henry Jackson lived in the house at the corner of Middle
street and Cole’s Hill, and died there, September 29, 1835.
His son, Henry Foster Jackson, who succeeded him in business,
died in the same house, March 10, 1868. While I remember
the personality of the father, I recall nothing of his
character, but the fact that he was fourteen years a member of
the board of Selectmen shows him to have been a respected
and trusted citizen. The son, never taking special interest in
town matters, was closely observant of public affairs, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
reliable authority on all questions relating to the nautical history
of the town.</p>

<p>Southworth Shaw lived in the house now standing at the
southerly corner of Court and Vernon streets, which had been
occupied by his ancestors since 1701, when the southerly part
of the house was built, and it is now owned and partially occupied
by his granddaughter, Lucia Shaw, having been in
the family more than two hundred years. He had seven children,
Southworth, late of Boston, Ichabod, Betsey, who married
the late Wm. Bramhall of Boston, Maria, Samuel of
Plymouth, and the late George Atwood and James R. of Boston.
He died January 18, 1847. His son, Ichabod, who continued
the business, died March 20, 1873.</p>

<p>The two painters on Water street were Isaac and John Tribble.
Isaac Tribble’s shop was on his own premises a little
north of the blacksmith’s shop of Henry Jackson. He lived
in the house to which his shop was attached, until 1834, when
he bought the house recently standing next east of the house
of John Russell on North street, where he died, Feb. 16, 1865.
John Tribble’s shop stood north of the shop now occupied by
Winslow B. Standish, and he lived at the corner of High street
and Ring Lane, where he died, June 2, 1862.</p>

<p>The pump and blockmakers on Water street were John
Sampson Paine and David Turner. Mr. Paine lived for some
years in a building set back from Water street, and facing the
way leading from that street to the Middle street steps, and his
shop was in the brick basement of the house, and facing Water
street. Many years before his death, which occurred September
29, 1878, he bought and occupied the Samuel Robbins’ estate
on the north side of Middle street, including the hall, which
for a long time was called Paine’s hall.</p>

<p>David Turner occupied a shop at the foot of Leyden street
already described in connection with the Shaw blacksmith
shop. Over his shop was a hall, long known as Turner’s
hall, which was somewhat historic in its career. In that hall
a public female school was first established in Plymouth in
1827, under the direction of the committee of the Central District.
In 1827, Miss Laura Dewey from Sheffield, Mass., who
married in 1832 Andrew Leach Russell of Plymouth, opened
a private school for girls there, and in 1829 Horace H. Rolfe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
opened a private school. In 1832 Wm. H. Simmons, son of
Judge Wm. Simmons of Boston, opened a private school for
girls, and one of David Turner’s sisters, and Miss Louisa S.
Jackson taught school there for a time. For many years it
was a favorite hall for singing schools kept by Webster Seymour
and Wm. Atwood and others. I have always looked on
that hall as sacred to the memory of a lost musical genius, for
on my second day’s attendance at Mr. Seymour’s school I was
dismissed because I could not raise the octave. When I have
heard some of my fellow pupils sing, who succeeded where I
failed, I have regretted that the dismissals were not more general.
If I am not mistaken, in that hall the Know Nothings
held their meetings during their period of incubation before the
demonstration of their strength in Town meeting in 1854.
There also the Mayflower Lodge, I. O. O. F., was instituted
Dec. 3, 1844. The hall was only about thirty-five feet long
by about twenty wide, having an access to it by a flight of outside
steps on the westerly end with a closed porch at the top.
So deficient was the town in halls before Pilgrim Hall was
built in 1824, and before the hall in the hotel on the corner of
Middle street, built in 1825 was available, that dancing parties
were often held in this hall, and I have heard my mother say
that she once attended an anniversary ball there, use being
made of the shop beneath for a supper room, to which access
was had by means of a trap door in the floor, and a stairway
built for the occasion. Mr. Turner lived in a house a little
west of his shop on Leyden street, and died May 14, 1869.</p>

<p>The two sailmakers were Daniel Goddard, with a loft at
the southerly corner of Hedge’s wharf and Water street, and
David Drew at a later period, with a loft in the Bramhall
building south of the way leading to the Middle street steps.
Mr. Goddard lived next to my mother’s house on Cole’s Hill,
and I had occasion many times as a boy to thank him for his
kindness. If I wanted a ball of twine for my kite he gave it
to me, and if I picked out a pumpkin from the products of his
farm for a jack lantern, he made me a present of it. He was
farmer as well as sailmaker, and employed on his farm as well
as in his loft, Alpheus Richmond, his brother-in-law, and his
brother Nathan and John A. Richmond, the son of Alpheus.
Associated with him in the loft was Lemuel Simmons, brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
of his wife, who a few years after the death of Mr. Goddard,
which occurred October 30, 1844, retired from business. Mr.
Goddard married Beulah Simmons, and I have the liveliest
recollections of her house and neat kitchen and cool dairy,
where I, or some other member of our family, had our milk
pail filled with morning and evening milk. Those were not
the days of milk carts, for a large portion of the families in
town kept cows, and those who did not, sent daily to some
neighbor who did. The building up of the town has so far
reduced available pasturage near its centre that reliance for a
supply of milk now rests entirely on the remote districts of
Plymouth and on the adjoining towns. Not long ago I saw
an old assessor’s book for the year 1748, when with a population
of about eighteen hundred, there were kept in town four
hundred and thirty-eight cows, one for about every four of
all the men, women and children. In the last year, 1904, with
a population of about eleven thousand, there were three hundred
and forty-seven cows, or one for every thirty-two inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 1831 there were three or four besides Mr. Goddard, who
kept small herds of cows, and among them was Lemuel
Stephens, who near his residence at the foot of Fremont street,
then known as Stephen’s lane, had an abundance of pasturage.
In the above year Mr. Stephens had a milk cart, supplying customers,
and I remember his son Lemuel calling at our house
on the morning of the 21st of November of that year, and telling
us that the new Unitarian church had that morning been
struck by lightning. The son, Lemuel, must have been either
merely assisting the driver of the cart, or driving it temporarily
during Thanksgiving vacation, as in that year he entered
Harvard College at the age of seventeen, and graduated in
1835. The mention of his name recalls an incident in his life
as Professor in later years in Girard College. With many
people the memory of Stephen Girard, the founder of the college
was held sacred, and one of the articles on exhibition was
a suit of clothes which had been worn by him. Professor
Stephens told me that during the absence from home one Saturday
afternoon of himself and wife, he found on his return
that quite a party had visited his house. “What did they
want,” asked the Professor of the servant. “Oh, sir, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
sure, they wanted to see Brother Stephens’ old clothes.”
“Well Bridget, what did you do?” “Oh, and for certain, I
showed them some old clothes of your own hanging on a line
in the attic, and sir you ought to have seen what a time they
had over them, stroking and kissing them, and almost crying
over them.” “Well, Bridget,” said the Professor, “if they
call again, you may tell them they may have the lot for five
dollars.”</p>

<p>As I am getting somewhat garrulous and running away
from the main thread of my narrative, I may be excused if I
tell another story, which the mention of Girard College suggests.
It is well known that Mr. Girard provided in his will
that no clergyman should ever be admitted to the grounds and
buildings of the college. Some years ago a convention was
held in Philadelphia of the Masonic order, of which Dr. Winslow
Lewis of Boston, a distinguished physician and surgeon,
was a member. One of the entertainments provided for the
convention was a visit to Girard College. Dr. Lewis, whom I
remember well, always wore a high white clerical cravat, and
as the procession marched into the grounds, an official at the
gate said to him—“excuse me sir, but you cannot be admitted.”
“The hell I can’t” said the Doctor. “Walk in
sir,” said the official. It is an interesting commentary on the
will of Mr. Girard that profanity could serve as a ticket of
admission where the insignia of religion failed.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, as I have spoken of Mrs.
Goddard, I cannot refrain from saying a word about her
brother, Capt. George Simmons, the father of the late George
Simmons. He sailed for my father and grandfather many
years in command of the brig Pilgrim in foreign trade, and
was one of their most efficient and trustworthy captains. My
father was in Boston in 1824, fitting the brig for a voyage,
when he was taken sick, and Captain Simmons brought him
home in a chaise, to die two days later. He named his second
son Wm. Davis Simmons, born in 1811, the master of the ill-fated
packet Russell, after my grandfather, and a daughter,
Joanna White, born in 1826, after my mother. It always
gave me pleasure to meet and talk with him when in later years,
enfeebled by lameness, he was employed as weigher of coal at
the pockets on the wharves. He died, July 26, 1863, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
age of eighty-one years. I know no family with more marked
physical traits than the family of which he and Mrs. Goddard
and Lemuel Simmons were conspicuous members. I have
noticed these traits in other families in Plymouth, not always
the same, sometimes in figure, sometimes in walk, and again
in voice, in mould of features, and in ways of doing things.
They are such that neither time nor marriage can extinguish,
and any close observer may have seen them in the Jackson,
Kendall, Warren, Russell, Spooner and Simmons families, and
in the Perkins family of Newfields street.</p>

<p>Not many years ago I was in the Town Clerk’s office, and
seeing a man dismounting from a wagon in the Square, I
said to the clerk, “I never saw that man before but I feel sure
that his name is Simmons, or he has Simmons blood in his
veins.” When I went out and addressed him as Mr. Simmons,
I asked him if I was right in so calling him, and he said, “yes,
that is my name.” “Where do you live?” I asked him. “In
West Duxbury,” he replied. “Are you connected with the
Plymouth Simmons family?” and he said he supposed he was
distantly, but he was not acquainted with any of them. It
has always been interesting to me to observe and study these
family traits.</p>

<p>David Drew, the other sail maker, learned his trade of Mr.
Goddard, and began business about 1840. He lived many
years on Pleasant street, opposite Training Green, and died
within a year or two, more than ninety years of age.</p>

<p>The old fashioned coopers who in the first half of the 19th
century were numerous on Water street, have entirely disappeared.
Mr. John C. Barnes now buys shooks and puts together
twenty thousand barrels for cranberries annually. The
coopers whom I recall were David and Heman Churchill, Otis
Churchill, Winslow Cole, David Dickson, Ansel H. and Abner
H. Harlow, Perez Pool and Gideon Holbrook.</p>

<p>Among the riggers who had their lofts on the wharves, may
be mentioned, Lewis and Thomas Goodwin, John Chase, Merrick
Ryder, Coleman Bartlett, Isaac J. Lucas and Peter W.
Smith; and among the caulkers and gravers, Wm. Pearsons,
Abbet and Atwood Drew, Clement Bates and Eliab Wood.</p>

<p>The master shipwrights, who ought to be mentioned were
James Collins, Wm. R. Cox, Benjamin Bagnall, Richard W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Bagnall, Wm. Drew and Joseph Holmes; and among the ship
carpenters were, Gamaliel Collins, Samuel Lanman, Elias Cox,
Richard and Samuel West Bagnall, Abijah Drew, David
Thrasher and Isaac Lanman.</p>

<p>The house carpenter mentioned on Water street was Benjamin
Weston, who, associated with his brother Lewis, had a
shop south of the bridge opposite the foundry. He lived for
many years in the house inherited from his father, Lewis Weston,
on North street, immediately west of the house of the late
Edward L. Barnes, and died July 25, 1858.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter it will be pertinent, in connection
with those engaged in the equipment of vessels, to speak of the
patent windlass invented by a native of Plymouth. Samuel
Nicolson was the son of Thomas and Hannah (Otis) Nicolson,
and was born in the house which formerly stood on the north
side of Court square, Dec. 22, 1791. His father was a shipmaster,
and in the revolution commanded the privateer sloop
America, owned by Wm. Watson and Ephraim Spooner and
others, carrying six swivels and seventy men, with Corban
Barnes first lieutenant, and Nathaniel Ripley, second lieutenant,
commissioned September 6, 1776. Mr. Nicolson invented
in 1830 what is known as the Nicolson windlass, and was the
patentee of other inventions, among which was the Nicolson
pavement. He had two sisters, Hannah Otis, who married
William Spooner, and Caroline, the wife of Edw. Miller, and
the mother of the wife of Chief Justice George T. Bigelow.
He died in Boston, January 6, 1866, and is buried on Burial
Hill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p>In speaking of the part Plymouth took in the whale fishery,
it may be well to refer to the general history of that industry.
In the year, 1640, Thomas Macy came from Chilmark, England,
and settled in Salisbury, Mass. In 1659 he embarked
from Salisbury in an open boat with his family and Edward
Starbuck, and landed at Nantucket, where they were the first
white settlers. Not long after their arrival, additions were
made to the settlement, and to the appearance of a whale in
their harbor, which they succeeded in capturing, seems to be
due the origin of that great industry, for which Nantucket was
for many years distinguished. Whales were abundant in the
waters of the island, and for some years they were taken by
boats, which brought the dead carcasses to the shore, where
their blubber was peeled off and carried to the try pots of the
fishermen.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate their work, the fishermen erected masts
on the land with crow’s nests at their tops, in which in suitable
weather, observers were stationed, and when a spout was seen
the boats were launched. This method was pursued for thirty
or forty years, when small sloops were employed, making
shorter or longer cruises during the summer months, and
bringing in the blubber to be tried out on the island. Gradually
larger vessels were employed, furnished with try pots,
which made cruises to Davis straits as early as 1746, to Baffin’s
Bay in 1751, to the African coast in 1763, to the Brazil ground
in 1774, and round Cape Horn to the Pacific in 1791. I have
heard it said that Gamaliel Collins of Plymouth was one of
the crew of the first American whaler to round the Horn.</p>

<p>It is a little singular that until 1821 no persistent effort was
made in Plymouth to engage in the whale fishery. Whales
were always at certain seasons abundant in the bay, but as far
as I can learn only occasional attempts were made to take
them. It is recorded that while the Mayflower was at anchor
in Cape Harbor, “large whales of the best kind for oil and bone
came daily alongside, and played about the ship.” On the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of February, 1673, the town ordered that whatsoever
whale, or part of a whale, or other great fish that will make
oil, shall by the Providence of God be cast up, or come on
shore, within the bounds of this township, that every such
whale or part of a whale, or other such fish as will make oil;
two parts of three thereof are to belong and appertain to the
town, viz: the proprietors aforesaid, and the other third part to
such of the town as shall find and cut them up and try the oil.</p>

<p>The following entry is made in the town records: “The
marks of a whale left on record by Benjamin Drew of Plymouth,
Dec. 17, 1737; the said whale was struck by Joseph Sachemus
Indian at Manomet Ponds, the 25th of November, 1737,
there were several irons put into her, one was a backward iron
on her left side, and two irons on her right side pretty backward,
and one lance on her right side, the iron on the left side
was broke about six inches from the socket. She carried
away one short warp with a drug to it, and a long warp with
a drug without a buoy, one of the drug staves was made with
a white birch, one of the irons was marked with an I on the
head as the Indians think, with a blind S on the other side of
the head, the rest of the irons we cannot give an account of
the marks.”</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that though whales made their appearance
in Massachusetts Bay, and the means for taking them
were possessed in Plymouth, yet no serious movement was
made to engage in the business of their capture. In 1821 a
company was formed to prosecute the fishery, consisting of
James Bartlett, Jr., Isaac Barnes, Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge,
Benjamin Barnes, Henry Jackson, Ichabod Shaw, Southworth
Shaw, Atwood Drew, Thomas Jackson, Jr., Daniel Jackson,
Jacob Jackson, Josiah Robbins, John Harlow, Jr., Samuel
Doten, Nathaniel Ripley, Nathaniel Ripley, Jr., William P.
Ripley, Richard Holmes, Jr., Benjamin Bramhall, Wm. Davis,
Jr., and John B. Bates of Plymouth, John Wheeler and Luther
Gay of Cambridge and Stephen Griggs of Boston. Though
at a later period Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge were active in
the management of one or more whalers, they were young
men at the time of the formation of the company, the former
twenty-three, and the latter, twenty-one, and James Bartlett,
Jr., was the projector of the enterprise, and the leader in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
management. The company contracted with Nehemiah Newhall
of Berkley to build the ship Mayflower of 345 59-95 tons,
and she sailed for the Pacific in September of that year under
the command of George Harris. The fitting of this ship with
the hopes, which the advent of a new industry inspired, seemed
to arouse the dormant energies of the town, which the war,
so recently closed, had done much to paralyze. Coopers and
bakers and dealers in general supplies, as well as mechanics,
felt the quickening impulse, and the people of the town generally
were ready to contribute their capital in enlarging and extending
the new business. The Mayflower was absent nearly
three years, and landed between two and three thousand barrels
of oil. How much of her cargo was sperm oil, and how
much whalebone she brought, I have no record to show. Before
her arrival an oil and candle factory was established between
what is now Winslow street and the shore, about where
the house stands recently occupied by George H. Jackson.</p>

<p>The Mayflower made two more voyages to the Pacific of
about three years each, under the command of Capt. Harris,
landing about five thousand barrels, and in 1830 she was sold
to Gideon Randall of New Bedford, an interest in her being retained
in Plymouth by Jas. Bartlett, Jr., Abner S. Taylor and
the heirs of Atwood Drew. While the Mayflower was on her
first voyage, after the establishment of the oil and candle factory,
Mr. Bartlett, while in Nantucket on business, induced
Mr. Wm. Collingwood, then living there, to come to Plymouth
and superintend the refining of oil, and the manufacture of
spermaciti candles.</p>

<p>In 1822 another company was formed consisting of James
Bartlett, Jr., Josiah Robbins, Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge, John
B. Bates, Thomas Jackson, Jr., John Thomas, Henry Jackson,
Jacob Covington, Daniel Jackson, Jacob Jackson, Allen Danforth,
Isaac Sampson, John Harlow, Jr., Richard Holmes, Jr.,
Ichabod Shaw, Isaac Barnes, Lemuel Bradford, George Bacon,
Rufus Robbins and Ephraim Harlow. They contracted with
Richard Currier of Amesbury to build the bark Fortune of
278 47-95 tons for the same service. She sailed for the Pacific
in September, 1822, under the command of Peter C. Myrick,
and returned in 1825 with two thousand barrels of oil. The
names of the members of both this and the other company show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the interest taken in the new industry by men of all occupations
and professions, merchants, lawyers, traders, blacksmiths,
owners of cod fishermen, silversmiths and masons, and a determination
to make it a success. Among them appears the
name of Allen Danforth, who became in that year a permanent
resident of Plymouth as the editor of the <span class="smcap">Old Colony
Memorial</span>.</p>

<p>The Fortune made a second voyage of three years in 1825,
and a third in 1829, under the command of Charles P. Swain,
and a fourth in 1833, under the command of David Upham. In
1837 she sailed under the command of Albert G. Goodwin of
Plymouth, and in 1840 she made her last voyage from Plymouth
under the command of Wm. Almy. I remember the
Fortune well on her return in 1832, from her third voyage, and
her sailing on her fourth in 1833. Owing to shoal water at
the wharves, she made her fitting as did the other ships and
barks in the Cow Yard, and the whale boats as they came and
went loaded with supplies were especially attractive to the
boys. One of my schoolmates, Nathaniel Lothrop Hedge,
went with her. Being called out by Mr. Stoddard, the teacher
of the high school, to receive a flogging for some offense,
which must have been trivial, for he was never guilty of any
other, he quietly took his cap from the nail above his head,
and walked out of school to ship the next day for a three years’
voyage. Two other Plymouth men, I think, shipped in the
Fortune, John Barrett, who became the captain of a ship
from New Bedford, and his brother, William, who became one
of the best boat steerers of his day. On her voyage begun in
1837, George Collingwood of Plymouth was one of the crew,
and Ozen Bates of Plymouth shipped on that or another voyage
of the same ship. The Fortune was sunk to aid in blocking
Charleston harbor in 1861.</p>

<p>In 1830 James Bartlett, Jr., Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge
and Jacob Covington bought the ship Arbella of 404 26-95
tons, built in Bath, and in August of that year sent her to the
Pacific under the command of George Harris, the first Captain
of the Mayflower. She sailed again in 1834, and 1836 under the
command of Ellis E. Eldridge, but what became of her after
her return I have no means of knowing. I remember well the
Arbella hove down near the end of the new Long wharf, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
a raft under her bottom, being either caulked or sheathed or
both. My impression is that most of the whalers made their
voyages with either a bare or sheathed bottom. The process
of heaving down was resorted to where docks were not available,
and was safe in shoal water. The process of heeling for
the purpose of making repairs below the water line is sometimes
dangerous in deep water. The British man of war,
George, heeled at Spithead in 1782, was caught by a slight
squall with her ports open, and sunk with the loss of six hundred
lives.</p>

<p>In 1831 Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge, Jacob Covington, John
Thomas and James Bartlett, Jr., bought the ship Levant of
332 34-95 tons, built at Newbury, and in July of that year,
under the command of Thomas Russell of Nantucket, she
sailed for the Pacific. She returned with 2,700 barrels of oil,
and was sold February 14, 1835, for $15,600. This vessel
was under the management of the Hedge firm.</p>

<p>In 1833 Jacob Covington, James Bartlett, Jr., Josiah Robbins,
Jacob H. Loud and John B. Thomas, bought the bark
Triton of 314 49-95 tons, built in Durham, N. H., and in November
she sailed for the Pacific under the command of
Mason Taber. She made two other voyages, one in 1835, under
the command of Thomas Russell, and one in 1838 under
the command of Chandler Burgess, Jr., of Plymouth. On her
first voyage William Collingwood of Plymouth was one of
the crew.</p>

<p>In 1838 James Bartlett, Jr., Daniel Jackson, Abraham Jackson,
John B. Thomas, Jacob H. Loud, Nathaniel Russell,
Nathaniel Russell, Jr., Allen Danforth, Thomas Russell and
the heirs of Jacob Covington of Plymouth, and Thomas Russell
of Nantucket, bought the bark Mary and Martha of 316
56-95 tons, built in Westbrook, Me., and in December she
sailed for the Pacific on her only voyage from Plymouth, under
the command of Thomas Russell. Wm. Collingwood of
Plymouth was one of her crew.</p>

<p>The brig Yeoman, afterwards changed to a bark, was built
in Plymouth in 1833, by James Spooner, Southworth Shaw,
Ichabod Shaw, Ichabod Shaw, Jr., Benjamin Bagnall, Nathaniel
C. Lanman, Wm. M. Jackson and Stephen Turner, and
made several voyages to the South Atlantic, under the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of John Gooding and James M. Clark, and on several
of her voyages George Collingwood was one of her crew.</p>

<p>The brig James Monroe, of 114 91-95 tons, built in Sandwich,
was owned by Isaac L. Hedge, George Churchill, Nathaniel
C. Lanman, Benjamin Hathaway, Southworth Barnes,
John B. Thomas, Ichabod Shaw, Comfort Bates, Joseph W.
Hodgkins, Nathaniel Russell, Albert G. Goodwin, Isaac
Barnes, Thomas Hedge and Nathaniel M. Davis, and was engaged
in the Atlantic fishery, under the command of Simeon
Dike of Plymouth, and probably made a second voyage.</p>

<p>The schooner Exchange, of 99 91-95 tons, owned by Alonzo
D. Scudder, Henry F. Jackson, James Collins, Wm. Nelson,
and Rufus B. Bradford, was under the command of James
King of Plymouth, and Rufus Hopkins of Provincetown. She
made four voyages, in three of which George Collingwood was
sailor, and in one, mate, and William Collingwood was a seaman
when she was wrecked in the West India waters.</p>

<p>The schooner Maracaibo, 93 53-95 tons, built in Plymouth,
and owned by Atwood L. Drew, Josiah Drew, Ephraim Harlow,
James Doten, Ellis B. Bramhall, James Morton, Bartlett
Ellis, Andrew L. Russell, Benjamin Barnes, 2d, David Turner,
Lemuel Simmons, John Harlow, 3d, Robert Hatch, Nathaniel
Holmes and David Holmes, engaged also in the Atlantic
fishery, under the command of Capt. Pope and George
Collingwood. She was lost September 19, 1846, off Bermuda.</p>

<p>The only other vessels engaged in the whale fishery were
the schooner Mercury, of 74 34-95 tons, built in Middleboro
and owned by Isaac Barnes, Southworth Barnes, Ivory L.
Harlow, and Charles Goodwin, and commanded by Capt.
Nickerson, and the schooner Vesper, of 95 52-95 tons, built in
Essex, and owned by Bradford Barnes, Jr., William Atwood,
Samuel Robbins, Jr., Benjamin Barnes, Bradford Barnes, Ellis
Barnes, Nathaniel C. Barnes, Nathaniel E. Harlow, Bartlett
Ellis, Joseph White, Robert Hatch, Heman Cobb, Jr., Corban
Barnes, Jeremiah Farris, Samuel N. Diman, David Turner,
Charles Goodwin, Southworth Barnes, Joab Thomas, Jr.,
Nathan H. Holmes, David Holmes, Ellis Drew, Ebenezer
Ellis, Jr., and Edwin A. Perry. The Vesper afterwards entered
the fishing and merchant service.</p>

<p>James Bartlett, the projector of the enterprise, which seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
to promise new life, and an aroused activity in Plymouth,
stood in the front rank among the business men of his native
town. He was the son of Capt. James Bartlett, a successful
shipmaster in days when it was necessary that a captain engaged
in foreign trade should be something more than a navigator
and seaman. He had, to be sure, his sailing orders from
his owners, seemingly controlling his actions, but sailing orders,
in the many which I have read, written by my grandfather,
really left the fortunes of a voyage to the discretion of
the master. Capt. Bartlett died December 22, 1840, at the
age of 81. There were others whom I might mention,
some still living in Plymouth, who also represented the best
class of merchant captains.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartlett, when quite a young man, was appointed supercargo
on board a ship belonging to Barnabas Hedge, engaged
in foreign trade. Such a position, with the responsibilities
it imposed, was the best popular training school for a
commercial life, and consequently when he projected the
whaling industry in 1821, he possessed all the qualifications
for its successful management. He occupied for some years
the easterly part of the Winslow House on North street, but
in 1832 he bought the LeBaron estate on Leyden street, at the
corner of LeBaron’s Alley, and built the house now occupied
by his grandson, Wm. W. Brewster, where he died July 29,
1845, fifty-nine years of age.</p>

<p>With regard to the packet service of Plymouth there
were four packets within my lifetime, which are not
within my memory, the Belus, Capt. Thomas
Atwood; the Falcon, Capt. Samuel Briggs; the Sally Curtis,
Capt. Samuel Robbins, and the Betsey, Capt. Isaac Robbins.
There was a fifth, the Argo, Capt. Sylvanus Churchill,
which I have a hazy recollection of seeing at her berth at the
end of Davis’ wharf. Of the eight succeeding packets I have
very definite pictures in my mind. These, in the order of their
probable ages, were the Polly, Eagle, Splendid, Hector, Harriet,
Atalanta, Thetis and Russell. The Polly was a black
sloop, a dull sailer, unattractive in appearance, and poorly
equipped for passengers. Her captain was Joseph Cooper,
who lived in High street at the upper corner of Cooper’s alley,
leading to Town Square. At the northerly end of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
garden on Church street, then known as Back street, there
was a store house which, when he retired from the packet
service in 1835, he altered into a grocery store, which he kept
until his death, which occurred November 25, 1851, in the
83d year of his age. He was one of the last grocers in town
to keep spirituous liquors for sale, and his stock in these was
confined to Cicily Madeira wine. In 1835, or thereabouts,
one of my mother’s brothers, living in Nova Scotia, arrived
unexpectedly one evening on the stage, and finding that she
was out of wine to dispense the hospitalities of the occasion,
she sent me with one of those square bottles made to fit partitions
in the closet of the sideboard, up to Capt. Cooper’s for
two quarts of the above mentioned wine. I had nearly performed
my errand in safety, when slipping on the icy sidewalk
I fell near the doorstep and broke the bottle. Enough
wine, however, was saved for immediate purposes, but it was
the last wine my mother ever bought.</p>

<p>I remember that one afternoon in 1831, when two or three
of the packets had been wind bound during a long spell of
easterly weather, Capt. Cooper came down to the wharf in a
hurried manner, evidently about to make a move. One of the
other captains said: “What is the matter, old man, what are
you going to do?” “I am going to cast off and hoist my jib,”
the Captain replied. “Parson Kendall’s vane pints sou’west.”
“Hm,” said the other Captain, “I’d stay here a month before
I’d go to sea by Parson Kendall’s rooster.” This was before
April, 1831, because in that month the old meeting house was
taken down, rooster and all.</p>

<p>Sectarianism was active in those days, but Dr. Kendall was
so little of a controversialist, and so much respected, that he
occasionally exchanged pulpits with the evangelical ministers
in Plymouth and adjoining towns. On one occasion he exchanged
with Rev. Benjamin Whittemore of Eel River, and
after church a conversation between two parishioners was
heard—something to this effect: “Well, Captain, how did
you like the parson?” The Captain replied, “I don’t take much
to this one God doctrine.” “I guess,” said the other, “one
God is enough for Eel River, they only claim three in Boston.”</p>

<p>In this connection it may not be improper to refer to an
incident creditable to all concerned, which may interest my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
readers. The editors of the <cite>Congregationalist</cite>, the leading
New England Trinitarian Congregational journal, inserted in
its issue of March 4, 1851, the following notice:</p>

<p>“A premium of $30 is offered for a dissertation containing
the most full and perfect and the best narrative of historical
and other facts bearing upon the following question, viz: ‘So
far as Christian salvation is a change effected in individuals,
and may be known to them and be by them described to others,
does the saving power of Christ eminently attend upon a
knowledge of his life, as it is revealed in his manifestations
from his birth to his ascension; and is it reasonable to expect
that the redeeming effect of this saving power will be proportioned
to the faithfulness with which his life is studied, and
the perfectness with which it becomes known, and is contemplated?’”</p>

<p>After the decision on the merits of the dissertations had
been reached, it was found on opening the envelopes containing
the names of the authors, that the premium had been
awarded to Rev. Geo. Ware Briggs, pastor of the First
Church in Plymouth, Unitarian.</p>

<p>The sloop Eagle had her berth at Hedge’s wharf. She
was a snub nosed, broad beamed craft, without a figure head,
and painted a dull green, unattractive to the public and not
a much better sailer than the Polly. She was commanded for
a time by John Battles, Jr., but through most of the years of
my boyhood, by Richard Pope. Captain Pope was a genial
man, kind to his crew, and accommodating to his passengers,
and by his popular ways secured his full share of both freight
and passengers. After giving up the packet service, perhaps
about 1840, he engaged in other pursuits, one of which will
be mentioned in connection with the steamboats running on
the line between Plymouth and Boston. In 1849 he went to
California in the ship Samuel Appleton, sailing from New
York, and on his return he was for a time sexton of the Unitarian
church, and then was appointed keeper of the lighthouse
at the Gurnet. Later he was a town watchman for some
years, and died July 29, 1881, at 83 years of age.</p>

<p>The sloop Splendid was a handsome craft, well modelled,
tall masted, had a figure head, was painted bright green, and
was a fast sailer. To my youthful eyes she was the queen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the line. For a short time she was commanded by Richard
Pope and Sylvanus Churchill, but through most of my boyhood,
after 1832, by George Simmons. Capt. Simmons was
an energetic man, taking advantage of every opportunity,
running perhaps at times some risk, and making a trip to
Boston and back, while the vessels of his prudent rivals lay in
their berths. I remember seeing him leave the wharf one afternoon
at sunset with a full load of hollow ware from the Federal
furnace, and finding her the next morning but one, when
I looked out of my window at Cole’s Hill, lying in her berth
with a full load of hemp for the Plymouth Cordage Company.
Capt. Simmons, after he left the packet service, engaged for
some years in the coal business, and as wharfinger of Hedge’s
wharf, and afterwards until his death, as the manager of
trucking teams. He died June 4, 1886, eighty years of age.
Capt. Sylvanus Churchill died March 2, 1878.</p>

<p>The sloops Harriet and Hector, both probably built in Plymouth,
I speak of together, because they were of about the same
age, and looked very much alike. Both were painted a bright
green, and were good sailers. The Harriet had a berth at
Barnes’ wharf, and was commanded as long as I knew her
by Samuel Doten Holmes. Captain Holmes bought in 1829
the house with a brick end, opposite the Universalist church,
which he occupied until 1834, when he built and occupied until
his death the house next above it. He died October 22, 1861.</p>

<p>The Hector had her berth at Carver’s wharf, and was commanded
by Bradford Barnes for a short time, but chiefly by
Edward Winslow Bradford, who after the opening of the
Old Colony Railroad established with Samuel Gardner, who
had been a driver on the Boston stage line, the Bradford and
Gardner express. After some years he sold his interest in
the express to Isaac B. Rich, but again later he established
Bradford’s express, which he conducted until his death, which
occurred December 27, 1874. Bradford Barnes, who for a
time commanded the Hector, lived many years in the house
on the southerly corner of Lincoln street, in the house which
stood where Davis building stands, and in the house next
north of the Universalist church. He died January 22, 1883.</p>

<p>The sloop Atalanta was built in Plymouth as early as 1830,
and was commanded at first by Truman C. Holmes. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
afterwards rigged as a schooner, and as early as 1837 was
commanded by Samuel H. Doten. I think she had her berth
for a time at Carver’s wharf, but I remember seeing her loading
at Hedge’s wharf on the 12th of June, 1837, the day
after the Broad street riot in Boston, about which the crew
talked as they took in their cargo. Of Capt. Holmes I shall
have something to say in connection with the steamboat General
Lafayette, and of Capt. Doten in connection with the
Civil War.</p>

<p>The sloop Thetis was commanded by Isaac Robbins, and
had her berth at Hedge’s wharf. She was changed to a
schooner in 1843, and I saw her last about 1865, at anchor
off Marblehead Neck, loading with gravel.</p>

<p>The last packet equipped with any view to passenger service
was the schooner Russell, owned by N. Russell &amp; Co.,
Phineas Wells, and her commander William Davis Simmons,
which had her berth at Davis wharf. Having the business of
her owners she survived the advent of the railroad, and continued
in service until her wreck. Her fate was a sad one.
She left Boston on the afternoon of Friday, March 17, 1854,
with a crew, besides her captain, consisting of Erastus Torrence,
Alpheus Richmond and Ichabod Rogers, and with five
passengers, Harvey H. Raymond, and his son, Benjamin B.
Raymond, Elkanah Barnes, Edmund Griffin, son of Grenville
W. Griffin, and Henry H. Weston, son of Henry Weston. The
next day in a northwest gale, she went ashore near Billingsgate
light on Cape Cod, and with the schooner a total wreck,
all on board were lost. All the bodies came ashore at Wellfleet
and Truro, and as I was requested to act as administrator
of Capt. Simmons’ estate, it became my duty to visit the
tombs in those towns, where they were deposited, and after
their identification to arrange for their removal to Plymouth.</p>

<p>The cause of the disaster can only be conjectured. The
gale was from the west northwest, and as Billingsgate is
about east southeast from the Gurnet, where the Russell was
seen early Saturday morning, it is certain that she was driven
helpless before it. And as the bodies came ashore in the immediate
vicinity of the wreck, it is equally certain that those
on board did not leave the vessel before she struck. I see no
reason why if the rudder was under control, the schooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
could not, even with the partial loss of her sails, have been
sheered a little southerly to a lee under Manomet, or a little
easterly to a lee under Wood End. I am therefore inclined
to think that her rudder was disabled, either by striking a rock
at the Gurnet in getting away from her anchorage, or by
striking the tail of Brown’s Island in missing stays, and that
in that condition she became the prey of the gale.</p>

<p>Since the loss of the Russell the following freighters have
run at different periods between Plymouth and Boston, though
not in the order stated:</p>

<p>The Glide, commanded by Thomas Bartlett and Capt. Joy.</p>

<p>The Wm. G. Eadie, commanded by Thomas Bartlett and
Kendall Holmes.</p>

<p>The M. R. Shepard and Eliza Jane, commanded by Thomas
Bartlett.</p>

<p>The Shave and Mary Eliza, commanded by Kendall
Holmes.</p>

<p>The Emma T. Story and Anna B. Price, commanded by
Wm. Nightingale.</p>

<p>The Martha May, commanded by Wm. Swift, and the Sarah
Elizabeth, commanded by Daniel O. Churchill.</p>

<p>Besides the above there were two sloops, the Comet, Capt.
Ephraim Paty, and the Coral, Capt. John Battles, Jr., which
were quasi packets, running on no special lines, but sailing
for any near port to or from which they could find freight.
Before railroads were built from Boston to the sea ports of
Massachusetts, all kinds of freight to and from those ports
were carried necessarily by water. Thus packets were running
from Boston to every town of importance on the New
England coast. Those to the nearer places were sloops as to
Salem, Newburyport, Portsmouth, Barnstable, Plymouth and
Provincetown; those to places a little more distant topsail
schooners; those to Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Richmond, Savannah and Charleston, brigs, and those
to Mobile and New Orleans, ships. Plymouth had a very considerable
amount of freight to distribute, cotton cloth, nails,
anchors, hollow ware, cordage, fish and imported iron, sugar
and molasses. When these were sent in small amounts they
were sent to Boston by the regular packets, and transhipped
to the packets in Boston running on other lines. But if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
considerable amount of freight, a gang of rigging for instance
for Nantucket, a dozen or two anchors for New Bedford, or
twenty hogsheads of molasses for Hartford, or some other
port, were wanting transportation, then the Comet and Coral
found their opportunity, trusting to chance for more or less
of a return cargo for Plymouth or Boston. If they were needed
to go to Maine ports they were reasonably sure of a lumber
freight home. Indeed, as I remember, these vessels did
practically the entire lumber business of the town. Capt. Paty
died in California July 24, 1849, and Capt. Battles died in
Plymouth March 1, 1872.</p>

<p>There were other packets besides those of Plymouth seen
in our waters. There was the Juventa, a Kingston packet,
and there were the Duxbury packets Union and Glide, commanded
by Capt. Martin Winsor, the Spy, the Jack Downing,
Capt. Holmes, the Traveller, Capt. John Alden, and the Reform,
so that with the fifteen running to and from the three
towns there was rarely a day in suitable weather when more
than one did not pass the old square pier. In addition to all
the above, the Barnstable packet sloop Henry Clay not only
passed within sight, but frequently sought an anchorage in
the Cow Yard, or came to the wharves. The distance by stage
of Barnstable from Boston induced a large passenger traffic,
and she was fitted with a handsome cabin extending to the
main hatch, lighted by skylights, and containing ample and
luxurious accommodations.</p>

<p>There was one other vessel to whose memory I wish to pay
a tribute on account of the pleasant fishing parties on board of
her, in which I have participated. Her name was the Rainbow,
but whence she came, what her regular business was,
and whither she went, I never knew. She was a queer craft,
sailing well on the starboard tack, but as dull as a log on the
port tack. She would loaf along up Saquish channel with the
wind southwest, but after rounding the pier she would come
up Beach channel like a race horse. She reminded me of the
story of a traveller, who said he saw in South America a race
of goats made with two long legs on one side and two short
ones on the other, so that they could walk easily round the
mountain side. A sailor in the group cried out: “Belay
there, Captain, how did them air goats sail on t’other tack?”</p>

<p>It is singular that the spirit of invention and enterprise,
which New England has displayed in the advance
of civilization, should have been apparently indifferent
in the development of steam navigation. It is true that her
activities have been fully exerted in other directions, and that,
as necessity is the mother of invention, the requirements of
her manufacturing industries have demanded to the fullest
extent the display of her genius. The Hudson River and
New York bay seem to have been the theatre in which those
early experiments were made, which laid the foundation in
this country of successful navigation by steam. In these experiments,
as early as 1803, Robert Fulton, assisted by Chancellor
R. Livingston, seems to have led the way. In 1804 Col.
John Stevens made a trial of a propelling power, consisting
of a small engine and a screw. He later attached two screws
to the engine, and the identical machine which he used is now
owned by the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken,
New Jersey. It was placed on a new hull in 1844, and made
on the Hudson eight miles an hour. In 1806 Robert Fulton
built a sidewheel boat one hundred and thirty feet long, propelled
by steam, with paddles 15 feet in diameter, and floats
with two feet dip, and went to Albany at the rate of five miles
an hour. This boat was called the Clermont, the name of the
seat on the Hudson of Chancellor Livingston, and in 1808
made regular trips from New York to Albany.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on, causing a complete
revolution in the commercial life of the country, New England
never saw the smoke of a steamboat. The first boat to enter
Massachusetts Bay was the Massachusetts, built in Philadelphia,
and designed by its owners, Joseph and John H. Andrews,
Wm. Fettyplace, Stephen White, Andrew Watkins
and Andrew Bell, to run between Boston and Salem. After
a few unsuccessful trips she was sent to Charleston, S. C.,
and was lost on the passage.</p>

<p>The next steamboat to enter the waters of Massachusetts
was the Eagle, which was built in New York and had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
for a time in Chesapeake Bay, under command of Capt. Moses
Rogers, who was later commander of the steamboat Savannah,
the first steam vessel to cross the Atlantic. She came to Plymouth
in 1818, commanded by Lemuel Clark. Capt. Clark was
either a Plymouth man, or the son of a Plymouth man, and
had married in 1817 Lydia Bartlett, daughter of the late Ezra
Finney, who lived, as many of my readers will remember, on
the westerly corner of Summer and Spring streets. He had
a son, William, one of my school and playmates, the father
of William Clark, now living on Cushman street, who at one
time was the master of the bark Evangeline of Boston. It is
probable that Capt. Lemuel Clark was induced by his connection
with Plymouth to bring his vessel here, where she
must have been an object of great interest to the people of
Plymouth and the adjoining towns. She remained here a number
of days, having her berth at Carver’s wharf and taking
daily excursion parties into the bay. She was eight hours on
her passage from Boston, making about five and one-half
statute miles per hour. On her return to Boston she ran for
a time on the Hingham line, but I have no record of her later
history. A picture of her in oil hangs on the walls of Pilgrim
Hall, taken from a contemporaneous drawing, and presented,
through the good offices of Mr. George P. Cushing,
the manager of the Nantasket Steamboat Company, by the
artist to the Pilgrim Society, and occupies a frame given by
the grandchildren of Capt. Lemuel Clark.</p>

<p>There is no record of the visit of any other steamboat to
Plymouth until the advent of the General Lafayette, in 1828.
She was built in New York in 1824, and bought in Boston by
James Bartlett, Jr., James Spooner and Jacob Covington, with
the view of establishing a steamboat line between Plymouth
and Boston. According to her enrolment in the Plymouth
Custom House, issued September 16, 1828, her name was
General Lafayette, with one deck, two masts, 82 feet, 7 inches
long, 6 feet, 1 inch deep, and measured 92 54-95 tons. For her
better accommodation the owners of the boat bought Jackson’s
wharf at the foot of North street, and contracted with
Jacob and Abner S. Taylor to build at the end of the wharf
an extension nine hundred feet long and twenty-eight feet
wide with a T at the end projecting northwesterly one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
feet square. The extension built of piles and timber and
plank was not completed until the autumn of 1828. In the
meantime the Lafayette ran through the summer of that year
from Hedge’s wharf, leaving Plymouth at hours when the
tide served, and leaving Boston at hours which on her arrival
would enable her to reach her dock. Of course her fuel was
wood, and she made the passage in five hours, making about
eight and one-half statute miles per hour. The point reached
by the wharf was that point on what was called the Town
Guzzle, where at mean low tide there were four or five feet
of water. With that depth of water a small steamboat like
the General Lafayette could reach the extreme end of the
wharf at all times of tide. The Town Guzzle was a circuitous
one. It left Broad channel at its extreme southwesterly end,
and running southwesterly five or six hundred feet, it made
an easy curve; thence running northwesterly about eight hundred
feet, and thence with another easy curve running southwesterly
about four hundred feet to a point reached by the
wharf. It was perhaps forty feet wide, and with sufficient
water beyond that width for the dip of paddle wheels, at any
time except within an hour of low water, there was rarely any
detention. Steamboats of moderate length found little difficulty
in rounding the curves, but those of greater length found
it anything but easy work. I remember once the steamboat
Connecticut left the wharf at near low tide, with a spring line
from her bow to the wharf to twitch her round the curve, and
as the line tautened, it snapped, the hither end coming back
like a whip lash and tripping up, without serious injury,
about a dozen persons standing near the cap log. I learned
the lesson then and there to always stand at a distance from
a spring line.</p>

<p>In the angle where the T joined the main wharf, there was
a flight of substantial steps, where boats at all times could
land, drawing not over two feet of water. This was a great
convenience, enabling Sam Burgess, with his fish for the
market, lobster boats from the Gurnet, and the Island and
Saquish boats, to land without regard to the stage of the tide.
Many a householder with his mouth made up for a fish dinner
has sat by the hour together at the head of those steps,
waiting for Sam. In those days, too, the only purveyor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
lobsters was Joseph Burgess, the keeper of the light, and as
regular as the day he would appear with his lobsters and wearing
his red thrum cap, would wheel his barrow full about the
town. There was no talk then of short lobsters, nor of extravagant
prices, for nine pence, or twelve and a half cents in
the currency of the time, would buy a three or four pound
lobster. The scarcity and small size of this delicious shell fish
in our day have not been satisfactorily explained. I am inclined
to think that the cause is not to be found in the excessive
amount of their catch, but in the appearance on our
shores, and the increasing numbers, of the tautog, which not
only exhausts the food, which the lobster feeds upon, but also
feeds on the lobster itself. In my early boyhood, if I am not
mistaken, the tautog was an unknown fish north of Cape Cod.
The sandy shores of Barnstable county formed an effectual
barrier to its northern migration. I think that about 1830
Capt. Josiah Sturgis, commander of the Revenue Cutter
Hamilton, brought some live tautog round the Cape and dropped
them in Plymouth Bay. A very few years afterwards the
first tautog was caught off Manomet, and one or two years
later several were caught off the Gurnet, while now they are
found all along the shores of Massachusetts and Maine. To
this new fish, in my judgment, may fairly be attributed the
gradual disappearance of a food fish which was once abundant
and cheap.</p>

<p>Returning now to the Lafayette, it can only be said that her
career was a short one. Under the command of Capt. Truman
C. Holmes, with Seth Morton as steward, she ran through
the seasons of 1828 and 1829, the latter year making her berth
at Long wharf, or steamboat wharf, as for many years it was
called, and then was laid up in Tribble’s Dock, or building
yard, as it was called, north of the wharf to die. Her upperworks
were removed, and her engine taken out, and my only
recollection of the vessel is of a dismantled hulk with her
planking stripped off, and her timbers fastened to the keel,
standing otherwise unsupported, just visible at high tide above
the surface of the water. The only incident of her service,
which I remember, was an attempt with a party of excursionists,
of which my mother was one, to go to Boston and return
the same day. Night came without her return, and about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
midnight my mother reached home, having ridden from Scituate,
where the steamboat had put in out of wood. Capt.
Holmes, her commander, took command in 1830 of the new
packet sloop Atalanta, and served with her several years until
she was altered to a schooner, and placed under command first
of Sylvanus Churchill, and then of Samuel H. Doten. He
died March 14, 1880, eighty-five years of age.</p>

<p>In 1830, the year after the Lafayette ceased to run, the
steamboat Rushlight, Capt. Currie, came to Plymouth and advertised
to carry passengers to Boston for a dollar and a quarter,
the fare by stage being two dollars, but how long this arrangement
continued I do not know.</p>

<p>I know of no other steamboat in Plymouth until 1839, when
the Suffolk ran on excursions to Boston and elsewhere during
July and August. In 1840 a small steamboat, the Hope, Capt.
Van Pelt, with a light draft, made regular trips to and from
Boston during a part of the season. I recall an incident suggested
by the mention of her name. On the 11th of September
in that year I was called to Plymouth, being then in college,
on account of the death of my brother-in-law, Ebenezer G.
Parker, and left an order at the stage office in the City Hotel
on Brattle street, to be called for by the stage at my grandmother’s
in Winthrop Place, leading out of Summer street.
The Hope left Boston at two o’clock, reaching Plymouth at
six. The leaving hour of the stage was the same, and as
the passengers on that day were few in number, it was exactly
two when I took my seat by the side of Samuel Gardner, the
driver. As we started, Mr. Gardner said to me, “Mr. Davis,
I am going to beat the boat today.” The air was clear and
exhilarating, the four horses were in good trim, and the road
was in its best condition. Mr. Gardner did not leave the box
during the trip, the horses were ready at the three places
where changes were made, and as I dismounted at my mother’s
house at Cole’s Hill, the boat passengers were coming up
the wharf. I doubt very much whether any regular stage
line in this country has ever travelled as our stage did that day,
thirty-six miles in four hours.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1840 the steamboat Connecticut came to Plymouth
and took excursion parties into the bay, but I do not remember
that she made any regular trips to Boston. In 1844,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
if I am correct in the dates, the steamboat Express, Capt. Sanford,
ran between Boston and Barnstable, stopping at Plymouth
to leave and take passengers. She was a good boat,
and made the passage to Plymouth in three and a half hours.
Her managers had built a flat bottomed barge with scow ends,
which, under the charge of Capt. Richard Pope, at low water
met her at the upper end of Broad Channel, and exchanged
passengers and freight. The return of the barge, by the way
of the Guzzle, especially with wind and tide against her, was
sometimes tedious, frequently consuming an hour. In 1844
the steamer Yacht ran a part of the season.</p>

<p>After 1845 I know of no steamboats coming to Plymouth,
except occasionally on excursions from Boston for the day,
until 1880. In the meantime the wharf began to suffer from
storms and decay. Of course it was convenient for vessels to
make fast to, until they could reach their regular berths, and in
northeast storms it served as a barrier to protect the vessels
at the short wharves from the wind and waves. At one time a
bathing house was constructed beneath its flooring. Two
bathing pools were built in two bays of the wharf, with plank
floors and walls, and steps leading up into two dressing rooms
above the wharf, to which subscribers, or those buying tickets,
were admitted. These bathing rooms served their purpose
for a time, but soon, like the wharf, needed repairs and were
abandoned.</p>

<p>In 1880 the steamboat Hackensack, owned, I think, by the
Seaver fish guano factory of Duxbury, made regular daily
trips to or from Boston, or both, during the summer, except
while she was repairing damages occasioned by a fire at
Comey’s wharf in Boston, where she lay. At that time the
whole wharf, except about three hundred feet, which had
been kept in repair, had by the action of storms and ice been
practically destroyed, leaving only about a hundred piles within
sight above the water. These were pulled up in 1880 by
the tug Screamer, some of them requiring a force of thirty-three
tons to start them from their beds.</p>

<p>In 1876 an appropriation made by Congress was expended
in dredging a channel fifty feet wide, and six feet deep from
Broad channel to the wharf, and in later years the width has
been increased to one hundred and fifty feet, and the depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
to nine feet, at mean low water. A basin connecting with
the channel has been dredged in front of the short wharves so
that not only can steamboats of sufficient size reach the docks,
but barges drawing sixteen feet of water find no difficulty in
berthing at the pockets of the coal dealers. In 1881 the
steamboat Stamford, commanded by E. W. Davidson, began
to run regularly from Boston to Plymouth and back daily,
and continued to run uninterruptedly until 1895, under the
same command, except during a part of one season, when,
owing to some difficulty between Capt. Davidson and her owner,
Nathaniel Webster of Gloucester, the former was temporarily
displaced. Capt. Davidson also ran the Shrewsbury
and Wm. Story each one season, and as a supplementary
freight boat after the close of one season the Shoe City of
Lynn. Since 1897, or about that time, the following boats
have run on the route: The Lillie, Putnam, O. E. Lewis,
Henry Morrison, Plymouth, Cape Cod, Governor Andrew,
and Old Colony. During one season the Stamford ran after
her name was changed to Endicott. During the last three
seasons the Nantasket Steamboat Co. have had exclusive leases
of available wharves, and have run the Governor Andrew and
the Old Colony. The latter is a new boat running in 1904
for the first time, and is recognized as the most convenient,
safest and most elegant excursion boat in the waters of Massachusetts.
The wharf is now, with three hundred feet of its
old timber and pile extension, owned by Charles I. and Henry
H. Litchfield of Plymouth who, having fitted it expressly for
steamboat purposes, keep it in excellent repair, and have leased
it to the Nantasket Steamboat Company. The Pilgrim Society,
owning Pilgrim wharf, refrain from leasing it to any
competing line, believing that the Nantasket Co. should be
encouraged in their efforts to establish a permanent and successful
enterprise.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to the embargo and to the Yankee
shrewdness which evaded the watchfulness of government officers
whose duty it was to prevent departures from port. The
following narrative, for the incidents in which I am indebted
to Capt. Charles C. Doten, illustrates the shrewdness to which
I referred.</p>

<p>During the Embargo, Plymouth’s fishing fleet was laid up
in the docks, and the owners found themselves cut off from the
trade with the West India Islands. The catch of fish from
the Grand Banks could not be sold to advantage for want of
this market, and after being cured remained stored in the
fish houses.</p>

<p>England and France then being at war their West India dependencies
were subject to blockade, and as a consequence provisions
which could be run into the ports of either nationality,
commanded high prices. With such a temptation it was not
strange that there were found adventurous men in fishing ports
to hazard the loading of vessels with dry fish, and disregarding
embargo penalties of our own government, surreptitiously depart
“for the West Indies and a market.”</p>

<p>Plymouth was not lacking in this sort of enterprise, and the
writer proposes to sketch one or two of the “run-a-ways,” to
show the character of the men of those days who a little later
did the country good service as “privateersmen” when the war
between the United States and England was fought.</p>

<p>Anticipating that these attempts to break the embargo would
be made in spite of stringent regulations, orders were given
to the customs officers at every port to keep strict watch and
prevent vessels from going to sea. Accordingly at Plymouth,
Water street was nightly patrolled, and a guard boat
well manned, and in charge of Capt. Joseph Bradford, was stationed
in Beach channel to intercept any outward bound vessel
which might succeed in getting away from the wharves.
With these precautions it would seem to have been difficult to
evade successfully the minions of the law and run out a cargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
of fish in defiance of all the Federal government could do to
prevent it, yet it was done.</p>

<p>The first schooner was the Hannah, lying at Hedge’s, now
known as Pilgrim wharf, which then had two or three warehouses
on it, one of them containing fish. On a dark night an
industrious gang of men quietly loaded the vessel from the
warehouse, but unluckily, before their work was completed,
the tide fell so that the Hannah grounded, and could not get
to sea that night as intended. Next day the custom house
officers noted that the vessel did not rise buoyantly with the
tide, so going on board they lifted the hatches, and at once discovered
“what was the matter with Hannah.”</p>

<p>Felicitating themselves that they had caught their mouse,
and determining that there should be no escape, they stripped
the vessel “to a girtline,” that is, they removed all her sails together
with the running and standing rigging, leaving nothing
aloft but a single block on each mast through which a line
was rove for the purpose of hoisting a man when the craft
was to be re-rigged. All the gear was carted away,
and, while the fish were left on board, the Hannah being absolutely
reduced to bare poles, the officials were perfectly certain
that they had made it impossible for her to take her cargo
to the West Indies. Of course the laugh went round town
at the expense of the defeated owners, and the officials were
“cocky” over their smartness. Weeks went by and the incident
passed out of mind, the deeply laden Hannah meantime
lying in her berth and daily rising and falling with the tide.
All the same her voyage to Martinique was made up, her captain
and crew engaged, and the man who was to rig and take
her out of dock had his gang picked for the purpose, and only
awaited his opportunity. This man was Capt. Samuel Doten,
father of our townsmen, the late Major Samuel H. and Capt.
Charles C. Doten, one of the most energetic shipmasters of his
day, whom nothing ever daunted, and who liked nothing better
than a bit of dare-devil business, being perfectly competent for
anything pertaining to seamanship or calling for executive ability.
These qualities were well known in this town, so naturally
he was “in it” with the Hannah. Capt. George Adams,
another old sea dog, was his right-hand man in the part he had
to do, and there were two or three others, who could handle a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
marlinspike and make a knot or seizing as well in darkness as
at noonday.</p>

<p>Capt. Doten lived at the foot of the Green, on what is now
Sandwich street and kept a boat on the south shore near the
place, where he afterwards built the wharf, now owned by
Capt. E. B. Atwood. The long waited opportunity came one
night with a howling southeast rain storm, from which the
Water street watch sought shelter in one of the stores. There
the officers with pipes and toddy made themselves comfortable,
while right before their noses the Hannah’s decks were alive
with her own crew, and Capt. Doten’s gang of riggers, who
had come alongside in boats. A loft which contained the gear
of another vessel, likewise clean stripped by her careful owner,
so her rigging might not get weather worn in the months of
the tie-up, was broken open and the shrouds and stays were
carried on board the Hannah. Capt. Adams was the man to
go aloft and put the eyes of the rigging over the mast heads,
and Capt. Doten arranged for a system of wooden tags to be
tied to the pieces as they went up, so that by feeling the
notches cut in the tags, Capt. Adams would know whether
what he received belonged on the starboard or port side. So
it was also with the blocks and halliards, and all being understood,
Capt. Adams took his place in the sling tied in the end
of the girtline, and was soon hoisted to the crosstrees. The
hours passed, but before daylight the Hannah was rigged, halliards
rove fore and aft, and sails bent, though both rigging and
sails were too large for her, belonging as they did to another
vessel of greater tonnage. Capt. Doten had met this difficulty
in the case of the standing rigging, which was too long,
by turning up the ends of the shrouds over hand spikes used
for shearpoles, and passing the lanyards from the deadeyes at
the rail also over the handspikes, his deck men then setting taut
with the watch tackles they had brought, and seizing all off
securely. The sails were made smaller simply by putting
in a reef.</p>

<p>All was now ready, and the Hannah cast off and dropped
down to the end of the wharf. Capt. Doten, who was a good
pilot for the harbor, took charge, and with the hoisting of the
jib the vessel quickly fell off before the wind and ran directly
along the shore for High Cliff, there then being no Long wharf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
in the way. This course was taken to avoid the guard boat
which was supposed to be patrolling the channel along by the
Beach, the usual way of leaving the port. It was the top of
high water and there was little likelihood that with proper
care the vessel would touch anything. At High Cliff Capt.
Doten ordered the mainsail set and pointed the Hannah’s nose
for the open sea. Then giving the helm to her captain, whose
name the writer unfortunately has never heard, he gave the
course to steer, and the schooner went romping down by
Beach Point at a pace which left no chance for the guard boat
to intercept her, when from away up Beach channel Capt.
Bradford descried the fleeting sail. Before getting far down
the harbor Capt. Doten and his men wished the Hannah and
her crew a successful voyage, and jumping into their boat
towing alongside were, before the early morning, snugly
stowed away in their respective homes. Of course there was
great excitement when it was found the bird had flown, and
instantly the conclusion was reached that “Sam Doten had
run away with the Hannah,” so the officers at once repaired
to his house where his wife was unconcernedly getting breakfast,
and Capt. Doten, having apparently just arisen, was leisurely
dressing. The officers were greatly surprised at finding
him and he equally surprised to learn from them that the Hannah
had got away, nor did he hesitate to express his gratification
that the custom house gang had been so thoroughly outwitted.</p>

<p>The Hannah made an excellent run to the West Indies and
arrived safely at Martinique, where she sold her fish at $20
per quintal of 112 pounds and the vessel also was disposed of,
the aggregate sum which ultimately got around to her owners
being a very handsome one for the venture.</p>


<p class="center no-indent"><em>The Hope and the Cutter.</em></p>

<p>The brig Hope was the next Plymouth vessel to “run the
embargo.” She belonged to William Holmes of this town,
and loaded a cargo of dry fish at Provincetown, where she
was seized by the customs officers of that port, and anchored
in the harbor, with a revenue cutter commanded by Capt.
Thomas Nicolson of Plymouth lying near at hand to prevent
her from going to sea. Under these circumstances her owner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
induced Capt. Samuel Doten, who had “assisted” in the Hannah
adventure, to become the principal in “cutting out” the
Hope from under the guns of the revenue vessel.</p>

<p>Selecting his crew, Capt. Doten took charge of the brig
and waited for things to come around to his liking. What he
wanted was a smart northeast gale, which is a fair wind out
of Provincetown, though of course a pretty rough affair to
contend with in the open bay, and against which he would
have to work his vessel out past the Cape after getting clear
of the harbor. No abler or more daring seaman ever trod a
deck, and, whatever the chances, Capt. Doten was ready to
take them, so when one night the weather shut in “nasty” with
indications of the wished for gale the next day, he made his
preparations. A mooring line was run out aft to keep the
brig’s head toward the harbor mouth, so that her square sails
should immediately fill before the wind when hoisted. On the
yards the gaskets keeping the furled sails in place were nearly
cut off, so that while they still preserved the shape, they would
part and allow the topsails to be hoisted without having to
send men aloft to loose them as usual when getting under way,
much depending on gaining a few minutes over the cutter at
the start. Vessels of those days had hemp cables, and Capt.
Doten meant to “cut and run” when the decisive moment came.</p>

<p>With the morning the gale was piping smartly, and it never
occurring to the captain of the revenue cutter that a vessel
would attempt to go to sea in such a blow, he took his gig
with her crew and went ashore. The ebb tide left the boat on
the beach while Capt. Nicolson and his men were up town,
and meanwhile the sympathetic Provincetowners, ready to
help the Hope, stole the thole pins and an oar or two. This
was the favorable moment, while the cutter was disabled for
want of her commander and several men, for whose return
on board she would have to wait, so Capt. Doten cut his cable
and stern mooring line, quickly hoisted and sheeted home his
fore topsail, and was moving down the harbor before the
lieutenant in charge of the cutter realized the situation. Seizing
a musket he fired at Capt. Doten, who was at the Hope’s
helm, but made a bad shot. Then he let go a big gun at the
brig, which also was poorly aimed, and did no harm. It
served, however, as a signal for Capt. Nicolson to come on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
board, if he needed more than the evidence of his eyes. The
town was immediately alive with excitement, for the seafaring
men took in the whole plan and shouted with delight over its
boldness and sheer sailor-like daring. Men hindered more
than they helped while pretending to assist in getting the boat
down to the water, but at last, with her captain on board again,
the cutter got into full chase, firing her bow guns at the brig
in hope of crippling her spars if doing nothing more damaging.
Provincetown has rarely seen anything more exciting
than that running fight, and the story is told there even to this
day, as the writer can vouch, having himself heard it from an
old sea dog over there within a few years.</p>

<p>The Hope was a good sailer, and soon doubled round the
long, sandy point at the harbor mouth, across which the cutter
still continued firing, the shots sending the sand into the air
in clouds as they skipped over the beach.</p>

<p>After getting outside, Capt. Doten made more sail for the
better handling of his vessel, and one of his men, William
Stacy of Boston, went aloft to loose a to’gallant sail. Just as
he reached the crosstrees and gripped the shrouds for further
ascent, a shot passed so close to him that, holding by his hands,
the wind of it strung him out like a flag. Getting his footing
again he yelled: “A good shot, try it again,” and went on
with his duty.</p>

<p>The cutter soon got into the open bay where the sea was so
rough that her firing became entirely ineffectual, and she could
only chase. Capt. Nicolson, however, was one of the plucky
kind and meant to do his full duty by keeping the Hope in sight
if he could do nothing more. The gale became fiercer, and the
sea rougher as the two vessels got from under the lee of the
Cape, and that night the cutter was forced ashore near Scituate
and wrecked, but with no loss of life. Capt. Doten, with
a loaded vessel under him, which he knew how to handle,
made better weather of it, and succeeded in beating the Hope
out past Cape Cod against the storm, and in a day or two
was running for the West Indies, intending to make Martinique.</p>

<p>All went well until nearing his destination, when one afternoon
a big British frigate poked her nose out from behind
an island right across his path and fired a gun for him to heave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to. There was nothing for it but to obey, and a boat with a
boarding party was soon alongside. The officer wanted to
know where the brig was bound, to which Capt. Doten replied,
“West Indies and a market.” “You mean Martinique, don’t
you?” said the officer, “and let me tell you that had you got in
there the Frenchmen would have given you $25 a quintal for
your fish; but you will do well as it is, for I’m going to send
you into the English island of St. Lucia, and our people will
give you $16.” “Very well,” answered Capt. Doten, “I’ll go
to St. Lucia then.” “Yes,” replied the officer, “I’m sure you
will, as I’m going with you, for you Yankees are altogether
too smart and slippery to be trusted alone, with $9 on a quintal
of fish difference as to where you land them.”</p>

<p>So the Hope went into St. Lucia, where Capt. Doten sold
both fish and vessel, and later he found his way home with
$25,000 in Spanish doubloons, a large part of the sum being
sewed into his clothing, and the writer has heard the Captain’s
wife tell of letting him into the house at about two o’clock
one morning, and of their sitting up in bed together, ripping
out the gold pieces and tossing them into a shining pile, of
which “Hope told a flattering tale.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Revolution the cod fishery of Plymouth
was active and successful, and during the previous ten
years had employed an average of sixty vessels. During the
war it was of course seriously depressed, but after the declaration
of peace its recuperation was rapid. In 1802 it had reached
its maximum of prosperity, before the embargo and the
war of 1812 again crippled it. In that year there were thirty-seven
vessels engaged in it, employing two hundred and sixty-six
men, and landing twenty-six thousand, one hundred and
seventy-five quintals of codfish, or an average of seven hundred
and seven quintals for each vessel. All but six of these
vessels made two trips. The following list of the vessels engaged
that year with their tonnage, the names of the skippers

<p>After the peace of 1815 the fishery entered upon a season
of renewed activity, which continued with occasional periods
of relaxation until its final extinction. The government having
found during the revolution that fishermen made up a large
share of naval enlistments, adopted the policy of aiding and
encouraging the fishing industry, and in 1789 Congress passed
an act granting a bounty of five cents per quintal on dried fish,
and imposed a duty of fifty cents per quintal on imported fish.
In 1790 the bounty of five cents was increased to ten, but on
the 16th of February, 1792, the bounty of ten cents per quintal
was discontinued, and an allowance was made to vessels employed
in the cod fishery at sea for four months between the
last day of February and the last day of November, according
to the following rates: Vessels between twenty and thirty tons
were to receive $1.50 per ton annually, and those of more than
thirty tons, $2.50 per ton, but the allowance to any vessel was
limited to $170. In 1797 the allowance was increased one-third;
but in 1807 all bounties were abolished. In 1813 the
bounty was revived and the allowance fixed as follows: To
vessels from five to twenty tons, $1.60 per ton; to those from
twenty to thirty, $2.40 per ton, and to those above thirty, $4,
but no vessel was to receive more than $272. In 1819 an allowance
was made to vessels from five to thirty tons of $3.50
per ton, and to those of more than thirty, $4 per ton, but vessels
having a crew of ten men were to be allowed $3.50 per
ton on a service of three months and a half. No vessel, however,
was to receive more than $360. By an act passed in
1817, it was required in order to entitle a vessel to receive a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
bounty that the master and three quarters of the crew should
be citizens of the United States, but in 1864 this requirement
was limited to the masters. By an act passed July 28, 1866,
bounties were abolished, and duties on salt used in curing fish
were remitted.</p>

<p>The abolition of bounties was a blow to the fishing interests,
which was destined to be followed by a more deadly one. It
cannot, however, be said that it was wholly undeserved, for
the requirement of four months’ service at sea had been often
evaded. A very considerable number of the fishing fleet returned
home before four months had expired, and anchoring
in beach channel by night and cruising in the bay by day, spent
the time in what was called bounty catching, until the expiration
of the four months.</p>

<p>But a severer blow than the loss of bounty soon fell on the
fishery. In 1871 the treaty of Washington between the United
States and Great Britain provided that “fish oil and fish of all
kinds, except fish of the inland lakes, and of the rivers falling
into them, and except fish preserved in oil, being the produce
of the fisheries of the United States, or of the Dominion of
Canada, or of Prince Edward Island, shall be admitted into
each country, respectively, free of duty.” This treaty went
into operation July 1, 1873, to remain in force for ten years,
and further until the expiration of two years after the United
States or Great Britain shall have given notice to terminate it.</p>

<p>At the time of the repeal of the bounty law in 1866, the
product of the Plymouth fishery taking the returns from the
previous year as a basis of an estimate was as follows: Value
of fish, $261,053; value of oil, $24,530; bounties, $14,249, and
the number of men employed was 420. I am inclined to think
that the largest number of vessels ever employed was in the
year 1862, when sixty-seven were employed, but in 1873, the
year the treaty of Washington went into operation, there were
only twenty.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can judge the following is a correct list of
vessels engaged in the fishery since 1828:</p>

<p>Schooner Maracaibo, changed to a brig before she entered
the whale fishery, has been earlier mentioned without any details
of her loss. She sailed from Plymouth on a whaling voyage
September 12, 1846. On the 19th, in latitude 38.22, and
longitude 72.35, she was capsized, losing second mate, Wm.
Tripp, of Tiverton, David Sylvia seaman, and George Ellis of
Plymouth, also a seaman, who was drowned in the forecastle.
The masts went by the board, and the brig righted, and Capt.
Collingwood and eighteen men were lashed to the wreck ninety-six
hours with only a barrel of sugar to eat. On the twenty-third
they battened down the hatches and bailed the vessel
out, and on the twenty-fourth set up jury masts. On the
twenty-fifth they obtained from the bark Newton of New
Bedford two spars and gear, and a quadrant, and finally, after
being on the wreck twenty-one days, were taken off by the
bark Clement.</p>

<p>The question is often asked, what becomes of all the vessels
that have been built? Upon this question official records
throw some light. The last accessible statistics show that
during the ten years from 1879 to 1889, nineteen thousand
one hundred and ninety United States vessels were wrecked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
on or near the coasts, or on the inland waters of the United
States, and during the same period, sixty-six hundred and
forty-one British vessels.</p>

<p>There are several disconnected items which may be
mentioned in this chapter. The Sunbeam, sold a few years
ago, was employed in 1905 in carrying gravel from the
Gurnet to Boston, and the Sabine, sold at the same time, is used
as a house boat in Boston harbor by a Portuguese lobsterman.
The Maria of Plymouth, and the schooner R. Leach of Bucksport,
Me., were the first United States vessels to use, in 1859,
trawls in salt fishing. It was a method of fishing introduced
by the French, and until the above date was looked upon as
an experiment. It may not be generally known that there is
a Plymouth Rock on the banks. It is laid down in “Sailing
Directions for the Island and Banks of New Foundland,” etc.,
published in 1882, as one of the Eastern shoals, a group around
Nine-fathom Bank, which latter lies in latitude 46.26.45 N.
and longitude 50.28.06 W. Plymouth Rock has 15 fathoms of
water, and was named in honor of Capt. Burgess, of the
schooner Lyceum of Plymouth, who discovered it.</p>

<p>The following is a detailed account of the loss of
the Plymouth bark Charles Bartlett, which on the 27th of
June, 1849, was run down and sunk by the Cunard steamship
Europa. The incidents attending the disaster possess an interest
in themselves, while the trial in the English law courts
of a suit for damages brought by the owners of the bark in
the early days of ocean steam navigation, was an important
one, establishing as it did the duties of steam navigators and
their liability in damages for a failure to perform them.</p>

<p>The Charles Bartlett was a bark of four hundred tons, built
in Westbrook, Maine, and owned by Wm. L. Finney and others
of Plymouth. She left the Downs on the 14th of June, 1849,
bound for New York with a cargo of about four hundred and
fifty tons of iron, lead, etc., and with one cabin passenger and
one hundred and sixty-two in the steerage. Her officers and
crew were William Bartlett of Plymouth, Captain; Thomas
Parker of Charleston, S. C., first officer; Wm. Prince, second
officer, and George Parsons of Portland, Me., Wm. Rich of
Gravesend, England, Isaac Hanson, James Fraser, John Bell,
Joshua Carey, Levi Hunt, Wm. Perry, John Jordan, John
Jackson and Harrison D. White, seamen. On the 27th of
June, in latitude 50.48 N., longitude 29 W., in a thick fog,
which gathered after the noon observation had been taken,
the bark was heading northwest with the wind west by south,
close hauled and all sails set. At half-past three the captain,
who was standing on the weather side of the poop deck, caught
sight of the steamship about one point forward of the beam,
and about four hundred yards distant. He ordered his helm
up and shouted to the steamer to port her helm. The officer
of the deck on the Europa, however, ordered his helm put to
starboard, which order was countermanded before the wheel
had been turned one round. If the starboard helm had produced
any effect, it was of course to make a collision the more
sure, while if the helm had been at first promptly put to port
there is room for doubt whether, as the bark was all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
time going ahead, the steamer might not have slipped by her
stern without causing serious damage. As it was, the Europa
going at twelve and a half knots, struck the bark abreast of
her main shrouds in one minute after she was first seen, and
three minutes later the bark went down. The steamer’s bow
entered to within a foot of the after hatch, tearing away
twenty feet of the bark’s side, and suffering as her own damage
only the loss of her head knees and her foretopmast. At the
moment of the collision, about one hundred passengers were
on deck, and it was estimated that about one half of them were
killed by the impact. The captain and second officer and nine
of the crew and thirty passengers were saved, all but ten of
whom, who were picked up by boats, were saved by clinging
to the bows of the steamer, and climbing on board.</p>

<p>The Europa had a full passenger list, and the excitement
caused by the terrible scenes of the collision was followed by
a serious anxiety for the safety of their own vessel, which only
prompt investigations and the assurance of the officers that
the hull was uninjured could allay. Among the passengers
was Capt. Robert B. Forbes of Boston, who with that generous
impulse and heroic courage which had always characterized
him risked his life by leaping into the sea and aided in the
rescue of his drowning fellow men. For the service rendered
by him, a medal was presented to him by the Liverpool Shipwreck
and Humane Society, and another by the Massachusetts
Humane Society. The Cunard Steamship Company gave
twenty pounds toward the relief of the survivors of the Charles
Bartlett, and a free passage to America.</p>

<p>A suit was brought by the owners and underwriters to recover
damages estimated at twelve thousand pounds, and tried
in the English Admiralty Court, and the facts which I have
stated were presented to the court by the plaintiffs. The responsive
allegation in behalf of the Europa, claimed that the
collision occurred in the usual track for steamers, but that it
was two or three degrees to the north of the usual track of
sailing vessels. It denied that there was a concentrating point
in the Atlantic, and alleged that the noise of the paddle wheels
might have been heard in the direction of the bark three or
four miles, and that it was owing to some negligence that the
bark was not therefore warned of the approach of the steamer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
It further alleged that though the third officer ordered the
helm to be starboarded, before the order could be obeyed the
order was revoked, and the wheel was directed to be put hard
a port. The engines were stopped so that before the collision
the steamer had come up to the wind a point and a half. It
was still further alleged that the bark was going from five and
a half to six knots an hour, having all possible sails set, and
had neglected to fire guns, blow her fog horn or ring her bell
at short intervals, so that those on board the steamer could be
cognizant of her approach.</p>

<p>The presiding judge, addressing his brethren of the Court,
said that these cases are becoming so numerous that it was for
the interest of the owners of ships that they should be decided
promptly. With regard to the burden of proof, it is of course
necessary for the plaintiff to present all the evidence reasonably
within his power, but that after he has done that it rests
upon the other party to show that they have not been guilty
of the acts attributed to them. With regard to the distance at
which the vessels were seen by each other, and the time which
elapsed before the collision, nothing is more difficult than to
find consistent evidence. The conclusion of the allegation in
defense is in substance that the collision was either the result
of inevitable accident, or was the fault of those on board the
Charles Bartlett. What is an inevitable accident? Inevitable
must be considered as a variable term, and must be construed
with regard to the circumstances of each case. In almost
every case it is possible to avoid a collision by going at a slow
pace, or lying to during a fog, but the import of the words
“inevitable accident” is this, where a man is pursuing his lawful
vocation in a lawful manner, and something occurs which
no ordinary caution could prevent. Continuing, the presiding
Judge said to his brethren of the Court, “It is very easy to define
what is a lawful vocation, but it is not so easy to say what
is a lawful manner. The test is the probability of injury to
others, and that of course depends on circumstances, as for
instance the time and locality where the occurrences take place.
The object of our inquiry is whether in the case of the Europa
going about twelve and a half knots an hour in so dense a fog
that she could not see beyond one hundred and fifty or two
hundred yards, and in latitude 50.48 and longitude 29, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
was more than ordinary probability of meeting vessels. If
there was a reasonable probability of a collision, then beyond
all doubt she would be to blame. If, however, there was no
reasonable probability of meeting vessels in the track pursued,
she was nevertheless bound to take all necessary precautions
to insure safety. One of the most important questions as to
these precautions which we are to decide, is whether there was
or was not a sufficient lookout on board the Europa. The law
undoubtedly requires as a reasonable lookout the most ample
that could be adopted. Was there such a lookout on board the
steamer? According to the evidence the general practice on
the Europa in dense fogs was as follows: first to station an
officer on the foremost bridge; second, his junior at the Con;
third, a quartermaster at the wheel; fourth, a second hand in
the wheelhouse, and fifth and sixth, two lookouts on the topgallant
forecastle. There is some evidence also tending to
show that a man was stationed in case of a fog on the lee side
of the bridge, and also a man at the crank to convey orders to
the engine room. Now, the actual watch when the collision
occurred was as follows: Wardell, the second officer, was on
the bridge; Coates, a quartermaster, on the topgallant forecastle;
White, at the wheel, and Fern, another quartermaster,
at the Con, and I do not find any other person on the lookout.
The second man is placed at the wheel so that in case of necessity
it may be turned as promptly as possible. There is an
entire absence of evidence as to whether at the time of the collision
there was in operation any means of communicating orders
to the engine room, or whether any orders were really
communicated.” Continuing, the presiding Judge said: “You
will have to decide also whether there was more than one man
at the wheel, and lastly, whether the order to starboard the
helm, which is agreed on all hands to have been erroneous, did
or did not produce any effect in the case. Looking at the
rapidity with which the vessels were approaching each other,
the last mentioned consideration is one of importance.”</p>

<p>With regard to the Charles Bartlett the Judge said, “Was
she carrying too much sail; was there a want of a sufficient
look-out, and above all is it your opinion that she ought to have
sounded a fog horn or rung a bell? Whether she ought to
have heard the paddle wheels before she did, and neglected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
take measures to avert a collision, is one of the questions for
you to decide. But it is in evidence that even if she could
have heard them, no fog horn could have been heard on board
the steamer above the sound of the paddles.”</p>

<p>The Court retired, and returning at the end of half an hour,
Dr. Lushington, the presiding Judge, then said: “In conjunction
with the gentlemen by whom I am assisted, we have considered
all the points in this case, which I have suggested as
necessary to be determined, and I trust that there has been no
omission as to any one of them. We have come unanimously
to the following determination: That no rate of sailing by
steamers or other vessels can be said to be absolutely dangerous;
but whether any given rate is dangerous or not, must depend
on the circumstances of each individual case, as the state
of the weather, locality and other similar facts. That the rate
of twelve and a half knots an hour in a dense fog in the locality
where this occurrence took place, must be attended with more
risk than a slower pace; but assuming that it might be accomplished
with reasonable security, and without probable risk to
other vessels, such rate of going could not be maintained with
such security, except by taking every possible precaution
against collision. That proper precaution was not taken by
the Europa: First, she had not a sufficient look-out; second,
we think that no proper arrangement was made as to the engines;
third, because no person was placed to report to the engineers
the orders as to the engines; fourth, because no second
person was placed in the wheel house; fifth, that the order to
starboard the helm was erroneous. We are of the opinion that
if proper precautions had been adopted, the accident might have
been avoided, and that the collision took place for want of the
proper precautions. With respect to the Charles Bartlett, we
are of opinion that a good look-out was kept on board; that
she discovered the approach of the Europa as soon as circumstances
would permit; that she adopted all proper measures to
avoid the collision by ringing the bell and putting the helm to
port. Therefore, I must pronounce against the Europa in this
case.”</p>

<p>After the decision of the Court was read, Mr. Rothery, the
proctor for the Europa, gave notice of appeal. All appeals
from the Admiralty Court, which until the time of William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
4th were made to the High Court of Admiralty, are now made
to the King in council, and are referred to the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council, which committee is composed of
the Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench, the Master of
the Rolls, the Vice Chancellor of England, and other ex-officio
officers. The appeal in question was heard by Lord Justice
Cranworth, Lord Justice Sir James Knight Bruce, Sir Herbert
Jenner Fust, and Sir Edward Ryan, and judgment was
delivered by Lord Justice Cranworth, December 1, 1851. It
is unnecessary to relate the grounds of the judgment of the
committee, as they were for the most part the same as those
which entered into the decision of the Admiralty Court. There
is one part, however, to which I wish to refer, because it lays
down a rule for the guidance of ocean steam navigators, broader
and more exacting than any suggested by the Admiralty
Court. An important question in the examination of witnesses
was whether it would have been possible to stop the steamer,
or so far stop her as to enable her to get out of the way within
the distance between the two vessels when they were first seen
by each other. The preponderance of testimony was that she
could not if going twelve and a half knots an hour. The peculiarity
of this question is that an answer either in the affirmative
or negative would bear against the Europa. If she could
get out of the way and did not, she is to blame. If she could
not get out of the way, the committee say that “it follows as an
inevitable consequence that she was sailing at a rate of speed at
which it was not lawful for her to navigate.” The judgment
closes as follows: “Their lordships have come to the opinion
that the accident was without default on the part of the Charles
Bartlett and was through the neglect of the Europa. The consequences
will be that the appeal will be dismissed with costs.”</p>

<p>In closing the narrative of this important case it is pleasant
to remember the enconiums of the London press on the intelligence
and general demeanor of our late townsman, Capt. William
Bartlett, as displayed by him during the trial. The master
mariners of New England were fortunate in having in a
foreign land so worthy a representative.</p>

<p>The migration from New England and the middle states to
California in 1849 and 1850, was one of the remarkable events
in the history of the American Union. It was one of those
events, of which the history of the world furnishes many examples,
accomplishing in the end results far removed from the
purposes sought in their conception, and apparently carrying
out the designs of an overruling providence, in which man has
only served as its instrument. It is a question worthy of consideration,
whether the destiny of the American republic would
have reached its present measure of accomplishment, without
the inspiration which a mere thirst for gold served to excite.
It was another of those incidents, of which the Pilgrim colonization
was a striking example, which reached its consummation
through the aid of the merchants of London, who were looking
merely for discoveries of ores of gold and silver to reward their
enterprise.</p>

<p>On the 9th of February, 1848, while three Americans were at
work repairing the race way of Sutter’s Mill, on the American
fork of Sacramento river, a little daughter of Mr. Marshal, the
superintendent of the mill, picked up a lump of gold, and showed
it to her father as a pretty plaything. The discovery was too
important to be kept secret, and a letter written by Rev. C. S.
Lyman appeared in the March number of the <cite>American Journal
of Science</cite> announcing it to the world. No news ever
spread more rapidly. In the New England states, and in
Massachusetts, especially, a wave of migration set in, which
was as strong in Plymouth as elsewhere. The time was favorable;
the supply of labor was just then greater than the demand,
and the temptation to seek wealth in California became
almost irresistible. Those who at once made preparations to
go were the bone and sinew of the town, carpenters, masons,
painters and clerks, and for a time after their departure our
streets seemed almost deserted.</p>

<p>Among the first to leave were those who sailed in the Brig

<p>Of the above named persons, one hundred and seventy-seven
in all, the following thirty-five were from other towns. Abington,
James A. Young; South Abington, John L. Nash; Boston,

Pulaski, N. Y., Ambrose Harmon; Rochester, Mass., Seth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Blankenship, John Clark and Thomas Brown. Thus the number
going from Plymouth was one hundred and forty-two,
which number would doubtless be increased by those of whom
I have no record. How many of those in the list of Plymouth
men are now living I have no means of ascertaining, but of
those who sailed in the Yeoman only two, George Collingwood
and Wm. J. Dunham now survive. The last of the Yeoman’s
passengers to die was Alfred R. Doten, a brother of our townsmen,
the late Major Samuel H. and Captain Charles C. Doten,
who married in Nevada, and never returned to his native town.</p>

<p>Of Dr. Samuel Merritt, whose name is in the list of passengers
on board the brig Reindeer, I have something to say. An
account of the chief incidents in his career I had from his own
lips. He was a native of Maine, and came to Plymouth in
1845, and established himself in the practice of medicine. He
was a man six feet in height and large in proportion, frank and
honest in speech, hearty, but rough in manner, possessing great
will and energy, and calculated in every way to win the confidence
of the people. He was a bachelor, and at first had an
office on Main street, in the Bartlett building, where Loring’s
watchmaker’s shop now is. After Union building was built
on the corner of Middle street, he occupied two rooms on the
lower floor at the corner, one for an office, and the other for a
sleeping room.</p>

<p>When the California fever struck Plymouth it seized the
Doctor with great virulence. Aside from the temptations of
gold and sudden wealth, the idea of an expedition to the Pacific
shores appealed to his adventurous spirit, and he at once determined
to follow the wave of migration. Without a family
to consult, he began his preparations. Collecting his professional
bills, he invested his capital in the purchase of a snug and
handy hermaphrodite brig of about one hundred and sixty tons,
owned, I think, by Joseph Holmes of Kingston, which was then
lying in New York. Having nearly finished loading her with
such merchandise as according to the latest advices was bringing
high prices, he found that he had about five hundred dollars
unexpended. This amount, or a considerable portion of
it, he determined to expend in tacks, so one afternoon he started
to go to Duxbury and make the purchase at the tack factory
carried on by Samuel Loring in that town. Before he reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Kingston, he was overtaken by a messenger on horse back,
summoning him to return at once, and attend a man, who, while
engaged in painting the house of Capt. Nathaniel Russell at the
corner of Court Square, had fallen from a ladder, and was
thought to be seriously injured. As he had no time to spare
to go to Duxbury after that day, he lost the opportunity of
making a fortune in tacks, which he found on his arrival in
San Francisco were selling at five dollars a paper.</p>

<p>With such a number of passengers as he could easily accommodate
in the cabin, he sailed from New York in the summer
of 1849, and reached his destination in the autumn.
On the way up the Pacific coast a stop was made at Valparaiso,
and while there it occurred to the Doctor that it would be a
good plan to buy a lot of potatoes to fill up the hole which the
passengers and crew had eaten in the cargo. Starting one day
for the shore to make the purchase, a favorable wind sprung
up, and the Captain signalled to him to return. Thus another
good speculation was lost, for on his arrival at San Francisco
there was not a potato in the market. To his dismay the bottom
had tumbled out of the prices of nearly every other article
in his vessel, following for instance the price of lumber, which
had fallen from three hundred dollars a thousand to a price
lower than it could be bought for in Bangor. After disposing
of his vessel and cargo, and finding himself without capital, he
opened an office and began a practice, which he hoped to have
permanently abandoned. Doctors were fortunately as rare as
tacks and potatoes, and within a year his medical and surgical
receipts amounted to forty thousand dollars, a sum equivalent,
perhaps, to five thousand dollars in the East.</p>

<p>One day a Maine Captain called at his office, who was acquainted
with his family at home, and in the course of conversation,
told him that he had a power of attorney to sell the brig
which he commanded, and wished the Doctor would buy it.
“No, I thank you,” replied the Doctor, “I have had all the
brigs I have any use for, and I think I will keep out of navigation.”
The captain called in occasionally afterwards, and
the Doctor in the meantime thought, as the people of San
Francisco suffered during the previous summer from the want
of ice, that it might be a good speculation to go into the ice
business in anticipation of the wants of the next summer. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
next time the Captain called he asked him if he had sold his
brig, and finding that he had not, he told him that he would
buy her if he would go in her to Puget Sound and get a load
of ice. The Captain agreed, and with a gang of men well supplied
with axes and saws, the vessel sailed. In due time the
Captain reported himself to the Doctor, who said, “Well, Cap.,
have you got a good load of ice?” “Ice, no” said the Captain,
“not a pound; water don’t freeze in Puget Sound; but
I wasn’t coming home with an empty hold, so I put my
gang ashore and cut a load of piles.” It so happened that
piles were much needed on the harbor front, and the
cargo sold at once at a big price, and the brig started off for a
second load. By the time the second load arrived, which proved
as profitable as the first, other vessel owners had got wind
of the business, and the Doctor said, “now, Captain, we have
had the cream of this business, I guess we will let these other
fellows have the skim milk. You go up and get another load
and carry it over to Australia and buy a load of coal.” In due
time again the Captain returned, but without a pound of coal,
saying, that finding he would have to wait a long time for
his turn to load, he thought it better to take his money for the
piles and go down to the Society Islands for a load of oranges,
six hundred thousand of which fruit he had on board. The
orange market at that time was completely bare, and the profits
of the voyage were heavy.</p>

<p>“Now, Captain, go up and get one more load, and carry it
down to Callao, and sell out everything, brig and all, and we
will close up our business, and you can go home.” Thus by
good luck, aided largely by the shrewdness of his captain, Dr.
Merritt laid the foundations of a multi-millionaire’s fortune. It
is needless to say that he closed his office and sought favorable
investments for his money. He bought land in Oakland
across the bay, laid out streets, built houses, and in time became
mayor of the city, whose foundation he had laid.</p>

<p>I saw the Doctor on his last visit East about six years ago,
and he then boasted of nothing so much as of his yacht, which
he said was the finest on the Pacific. I have recently read a
journal of Mrs. Stevenson, the mother of Robert Louis Stevenson,
of a six months’ excursion in the Pacific for the benefit of
her son’s health in the yacht Casco, belonging to Dr. Merritt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Her account of an interview with the Doctor illustrates his personalty
and deportment which had more of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortiter in re</i>
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</i>. She says, “Dr. M. has just been
here to settle the final business arrangements. He had heard
that Louis had a mother, and was not at all sure of allowing an
old woman to sail on his beloved yacht, so he insisted on seeing
me before he left. When I came in I found a very stout man
with a strong and humorous face, who sat still in his chair and
took a good look at me. Then he held out his hand with the
remark, ‘You are a healthy looking woman.’ He built the
yacht, he told me, for his health, as he was getting so stout that
some means of reduction were necessary, and going to sea had
pulled him down sixty pounds. ‘The yacht is the apple of my
eye—you may think (to Fanny) your husband loves you, but I
can assure you that I love my yacht a great deal better.’”</p>

<p>Dr. Merritt died three or four years ago, and the last I heard
of his affairs was that his will was in litigation.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter I gave a list of the streets, squares, lanes
and alleys, which existed in my boyhood, with the promise to
say something concerning the changes, which they had gone
through, and the houses and people and incidents associated
with them. I have since taken a passing glance at Court,
Main, Middle and North streets with the intention of referring
to them again. In my treatment of Water street I have dwelt
in detail on its buildings and occupants.</p>

<p>The next street in order is Leyden street, the most interesting
of all the streets, associated, as it is with the first winter of the
Pilgrims, with the Common House, the store houses, and the
seven cottages, which with their walls of plank, their roofs of
thatch, and windows of paper, served as hospitals for the sick
and shelter for all. How far east and west the original street
extended is conjectural. It is probable that on the west it extended
at least as far as the fort, which in 1622 was built near
the top of burial hill, and that within a year or two habitations
for single families were constructed on both sides of the street.
The easterly end of the original street is more doubtful. It
must be remembered that what we call ropewalk pond was a
part of the harbor, a broad cove or bay with a wide entrance
extending from a point on the south near the southerly corner
of the present foundry, to a point on the north near the southerly
end of the Electric Light building. It is probable that this
cove extended so far west that it felt the flow of the tide for
some distance above the present arch of Spring hill. It will
therefore be seen that this bay furnished an excellent boat harbor
protected from the ocean blasts, and, being in close proximity
to the store houses, was undoubtedly used as a landing
place for boats, plying to and from the Mayflower during her
stay in the harbor.</p>

<p>In view of these conditions it is probable that the original
street extended no farther east than the narrow way which may
still be seen on the easterly side of the house with a brick end
opposite the Universalist church, a way which is referred to in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
ancient deeds, and which in my opinion led to the landing
place, and was used by the Pilgrims in reaching or leaving their
settlement by water. The first official laying out of Leyden
street was made in connection with Water street in 1716, and is
entered in the town records under date of February 16, 1715-16
old style, or February 26, 1716 new style. It is signed by
Benjamin Warren, John Dyer, John Watson and Abial Shurtleff,
selectmen, and reads as follows: “Then laid out by us
the subscribers, Town Wayes (viz) as followeth A street Called

John Ward’s land is: 30: foot in width Till it comes to ye stake
and stones at ye Easterly Corner of ye New streete.” This
laying out is especially interesting as mentioning Plymouth
Rock.</p>

<p>A part of the smith shop of Ephraim Cole, at the corner of
which the above laying out began, is still standing, and may be
seen in the rear part of the express office on the corner of Main
street. The corner of John Rickard’s land was at a point on
the stone wall opposite the middle of the alley next to the house
of Wm. W. Brewster. Capt. John Dyer’s house stood where
the brick end house stands, and the Ephraim Kempton house
stood about thirty or forty feet from the present street on the
lot now occupied by Mr. Blackmer’s stable. It is probable
that the land in front of the house was kept open, and that the
way across the brook began at the corner of the narrow way
above mentioned just below the Dyer house, and crossing the
open space diagonally, passed east of the Kempton house to the
fording place. All through my boyhood the Kempton house
was occupied by Mrs. Wm. Drew, who married for a second
husband in 1833, Isaac Morton Sherman, the father of Leander
L. Sherman, formerly the janitor of the Central Engine house.
Its removal many years ago marked one of the changes which
have occurred in Leyden street within my recollection.</p>

<p>Until, perhaps twenty-five or thirty years ago, there was an
ancient footway leading from Cole’s Hill at a point nearly opposite
the south front of the house of Henry W. Barnes, next
to the Universalist church, to Leyden street, directly opposite
to the way to the fording place above mentioned. That footway
doubtless ante-dated the opening of a way between Cole’s
Hill and the water, and served to enable those who were occupying
lots on North, then New Street, to make a short cut
over the hill to Leyden street, and thence to either the boat
harbor landing or across the ford to the south side of the settlement.</p>

<p>The John Rickard land referred to in the laying out of Leyden
street included all the land between LeBaron’s alley on the
west, Leyden street on the south, and the footway on the east,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
and extended to Middle street. It was occupied for one hundred
and eighty-seven years by a house built in 1639 by Robert
Hicks, which was taken down in 1826, when the Universalist
Church was erected on its site. If it were standing today, as
it stood when I was four years of age, it would be the oldest
house in New England, and invaluable as a relic of the Pilgrims.
It was reached by a path or private way leading from
Leyden street, and this way was never laid out as a public way
until 1827, after the Universalist church was built. A picture
of this house may be seen in Mr. Wm. S. Russell’s Pilgrim Memorials,
where in accordance with tradition it is called the Allyne
house, after Joseph Allyne, who never owned it, but merely
occupied it a short time as a tenant. It is often the case
that a passing and perhaps trifling incident fastens on a spot
or house a name, which has no rightful claim. I remember an
illustration of this, which made Hon. Isaac L. Hedge very indignant.
He was born in the house now occupied and owned
by Wm. R. Drew on Leyden street, and lived there until he was
married, the house remaining in the possession of his father
until his death in 1840, and of his mother until her death in
1849, and of their heirs until 1854, when it was sold. For a
short time after 1854, before it was sold to Mr. Drew, Zaben
Olney occupied it as a hotel. Mr. Hedge became entirely
blind, and employed John O’Brien to take his arm and walk
with him about the streets. One day in walking down Leyden
street he said: “Where are we now, John?” “Right by the
old Olney house,” John replied. Alas! “how soon are we forgot.”
The names of the wharves are gone, and Jackson, Hedge,
Davis, Nelson and Carver have given way to Long, Pilgrim,
Atwood, Millar and Craig, to be christened again by succeeding
owners and occupants.</p>

<p>So far as the bounds of Leyden street are concerned, there
has been no change in my day except the widening mentioned
in a previous chapter at its junction with Water street. The
changes in houses have been numerous. The Turner house
above the old blockmaker’s shop and Turner’s Hall, has been
removed, and its site occupied by the Electric Light Co. Nearly
in front of it, a little below, near the westerly end of the
blacksmith’s shop of Southworth and Ichabod Shaw was a public
well, on which the neighborhood relied for good drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
water. The aqueduct water delivered through wooden logs
from questionable sources, led our people to depend largely on
pumps or wells. These were scattered all over the town, either
public or private, and even to the private wells householders
were permitted free access. There were public wells at the
foot of North street, and below the bank at the foot of Middle
street, and there was the town pump at the foot of Spring hill.
Besides these there were the county well, a well between the old
Lothrop house and Judge Thomas’ house opposite the head of
North street, another between John Gooding’s and Dr. Bartlett’s
houses on Main street, another in the yard of Capt. Wm.
Rogers on North street, another in the rear of Jacob Jackson’s
house on what is now Winslow street, which was known
as Jacob’s well, and there was still another near the
sidewalk on Sandwich street, opposite the Green, between the
Elkanah Bartlett and Rogers houses. The wells on North
street and below Middle street were liable to be fouled by
drains, and their water was not used for drinking or cooking.
Before the introduction of South Pond water, the whalemen
and fishermen filled their water casks at a pump in the yard of
John Tribble’s paint shop on Water street. But the well in
Leyden street was the one to which I was often sent when a
boy with two pails and a hoop to get our daily supply.</p>

<p>There was another old house near the so-called Allyne house,
which I well remember. It stood on the bank with its front
door on what is now Carver street, nearly opposite the easterly
side of the house of Henry W. Barnes, and was reached by
the way from Middle street. It was for many years owned
and occupied by Wm. Holmes, the father of the three captains,
Samuel Doten, Truman Cook and Winslow Holmes, and after
his death, by his daughter Hannah, the wife of Laban Burt. It
was taken down forty or fifty years ago. The Universalist
church, and the parsonage east of it, stand on land bought of
Barnabas Hedge in 1826, with the agreement on the part of
Mr. Hedge that the bank opposite the church, which still belongs
to his heirs should never be built on. The Universalist
Society was incorporated in 1826, and the church was dedicated
December 22, in that year. The sermon on the occasion
was preached by Rev. David Pickering of Providence. On the
afternoon of the same day, Rev. James H. Bugbee was ordained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
pastor, the ordaining sermon being preached by Rev. John Bisbee
of Hartford. Between the time of the organization of the
church, March 10, 1822, and the ordination of Mr. Bugbee,
Messina Ballou and Rev. Mr. Morse and others, preached to the
society in one of the town halls. Mr. Bugbee was followed by
Albert Case and Russell Tomlinson, who resigned in 1867, and
was followed by A. Bosserman, Alpheus Nickerson, George L.
Swift, A. H. Sweetzer and W. W. Hayward and others remembered
by my readers. The parsonage house was at one time
owned by Jeremiah Farris, and its sale by him to Roland Edwin
Cotton, unaccompanied by whittling or dickering, was somewhat
characteristic of the purchaser. Mr. Farris meeting Mr.
Cotton in the street one day was asked by him what he would
sell his house for next to the Universalist church. Mr. Farris
named a price, taking care to name one high enough to allow
for a discount, and Mr. Cotton, without taking breath, promptly
said, “Too much by half, I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>The house next above the Universalist church, long known
as the Marcy house, reminds me of a gentleman at one time
its occupant, who for many years filled a large space in
the social and official life of Plymouth, and performed elsewhere
distinguished service in behalf of the state. Jacob H.
Loud, born in Hingham, February 5, 1802, graduated at
Brown University in 1822 and after studying law with Ebenezer
Gay of Hingham, was admitted to the bar at the Common
Pleas Court in Plymouth in August, 1825, and at once began
practice in our town. His first office was in the building at the
corner of Spring Hill and Summer street, which was taken
down a few years ago, from which place he moved in 1827 to
No. 3 Town Square, then called Market Square, which afterwards
became the post office when Bridgham Russell was appointed
postmaster in 1832. He married May 5, 1829, Elizabeth
Loring Jones of Hingham, and occupied for a time the
Marcy house above mentioned. From there he changed his
residence to the house next below Mr. Beaman’s undertaking
rooms on Middle street, but in 1832 he bought a part of the
Lothrop lot opposite the head of North street, and built and
occupied the house now owned and occupied by Mrs. F. B.
Davis. After the death of Beza Hayward, Register of Probate
of Plymouth County, which occurred June 4, 1830, he was appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
to succeed him, and held office until 1852. In 1853,
1854 and 1855, he was chosen by the legislature state treasurer.
From 1855 to 1866 he was president of the Old Colony
Bank, State and National, Director of the Old Colony Railroad
from 1845 to 1850, and again from 1869 until his death,
Representative in 1862, Senator in 1863 and 1864, State
Treasurer again by a vote of the people from 1865 to 1871,
and actuary of the New England Trust Co. of Boston until his
retirement in 1879. In 1871 he bought the house now owned
and occupied by Father Buckley, and occupied it during the
summer months until his death, which occurred in Boston,
February 2, 1880.</p>

<p>The next house built by James Bartlett, Jr., in 1832, has
been referred to in a previous chapter. It occupies a part of
the land given by Bridget Fuller and Samuel Fuller, the widow
and son of Dr. Samuel Fuller of the Mayflower, in 1664, to
the Church of Plymouth for the use of a minister. The easterly
boundary of the land was the middle of the alley, long
known as LeBaron’s alley. The house which up to 1832 stood
on the site now occupied by the house built by Mr. Bartlett,
was built by Lazarus LeBaron, and in my boyhood was occupied
by Dr. Isaac LeBaron, the grandson of Lazarus. Land
for the alley was thrown out by Lazarus LeBaron and James
Rickard, the owner of the adjoining estate, and was laid out
as a town way, September 7 and 10, 1832. At the time of the
Fuller gift there was a house standing on the lot which was
once owned by Rev. John Cotton, the pastor of the First
Church, and which afterwards was displaced by the house
built by Lazarus LeBaron.</p>

<p>The next house immediately west of the James Bartlett
house, stands on the site of a house built by Return Waite,
which when the present house was built not many years ago,
was removed to Seaside, and now stands a tenement house on
the easterly side of the road on land belonging to the heirs of
the late Barnabas Hedge.</p>

<p>As I have stated the land on Leyden street extending from
the estate of Wm. R. Drew to the centre of LeBaron’s alley,
was given in 1664 by Bridget Fuller, widow of Dr. Samuel
Fuller of the Mayflower, and her son Samuel, to the church
in Plymouth for the use of the minister. A parsonage was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
built on the easterly end of the lot, which was finally sold to
Rev. John Cotton, the pastor of the church. The house built
by Lazarus LeBaron on the site of the parsonage, which was
in turn succeeded by the house built in 1832 by James Bartlett,
Jr., and now occupied by Wm. W. Brewster, and also the
house adjoining the Bartlett house have been referred to, leaving
to be considered of the original Fuller land only that part
which is now occupied by the house of the late Harvey W.
Weston. When Rev. Chandler Robbins was settled over the
Plymouth Church in 1760, the Parish agreed to pay him a
salary of one hundred pounds, to give him the privilege of
cutting wood on the parish lot, and to build for him a parsonage.
The Weston house is the parsonage, built at that time.
It was occupied by Mr. Robbins until 1788, when he built a
house on the other side of the street, which he occupied until
his death, June 30, 1799.</p>

<p>Rev. James Kendall, the successor of Mr. Robbins, was
ordained January 1, 1800, and occupied the parsonage until
his death, which occurred March 17, 1859, and it was sold
the next year to Mr. Weston. Of Dr. Kendall, whose pastorate
extended through a period of sixty years, I cannot forbear
to speak, as his life was one of the most important passages
in the history of our town. It is difficult to realize that
more than a generation has been born, and has lived to nearly
middle age, without a knowledge of his personality and a daily
observation of his character and virtues. He was born in
Sterling, Mass., in 1769, and after graduating at Harvard in
1796, occupied the position of tutor in Latin at Harvard until
he received an invitation to settle in Plymouth. At his ordination
the sermon was preached by Rev. Mr. French of Andover,
and the other parts of the ceremony were performed by Rev.
Dr. Peter Thatcher, Rev. Dr. Tappan, Rev. Mr. Shaw and
Rev. Mr. Howland. In 1825 he received the degree of Doctor
of Divinity from Harvard, by whose government he was esteemed
one of the distinguished incumbents of the ministry.
I was in my early youth impressed by the benignant traits in
his character and the purity of his life, as it was my fortune
when nine years of age to be for a few weeks a member of his
family, while my mother was passing a summer with her father
in Nova Scotia. I remember him sitting in his study in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
back west room, where if I happened to enter I was always
greeted with a kindly smile and a cheerful word; I remember
him in the front east room on a chilly day sitting by a Franklin
stove, and often in the garden, which he tended with loving
and faithful care. There was a vein of humor in his composition,
which, unlike that I have often seen repressed on the
Sabbath by ministers of the olden time, was too much the overflow
of a contented and joyful spirit to be concealed on a day
to him the happiest of the week. As long as I can remember
he always carried a cane, which had descended to him through
James, his father, James, his grandfather, and Samuel, his
great-grandfather; from Thomas, son of Francis, who was
born in 1649 in Woburn. This cane is now owned by his
grandson, Arthur Lord of Plymouth, and represents an ownership
by seven generations of the same family.</p>

<p>I remember him in the old meeting house, which was taken
down in April, 1831, officiating in black gloves with a sounding
board hanging over the pulpit, which I was in constant
fear would fall on the dear man’s head. I remember well the
church itself, a large, square building with doors on three
sides, and a steeple surmounted by a copper rooster, the like
of which I have never seen since the day when in April, 1831,
while workmen pulled the steeple over, it slipped off the spindle
and took its unaided flight to the ground. I remember the
square pews with seats, which were turned up in prayer time,
and let down with a slam when the prayer was over, and I
especially remember the spokes in the pew rails which we boys
turned in their dowels and made to squeak when we thought
that James Morton, the sexton, sitting at the head of the pulpit
stairs, was either not looking or was asleep. And then
there was the choir, with Webster Seymour leading the singing,
and I can see even now Simeon Dike, father of the late
Mrs. Samuel Shaw, drawing his bow across the bass viol,
which I think, with the violin and clarinet performed the instrumental
music.</p>

<p>Of Dr. Kendall, it may be appropriately said as was said of
another:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pure was his walk, peaceful was his end;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We blessed his reverend length of days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hailed him in the public ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With veneration and with praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our father and our friend.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>
<p>The custom of wearing black gloves in the pulpit referred to
above, which had once been universal, was abandoned before
the middle of the last century, and I do not feel sure that Dr.
Kendall wore them in the new meeting house, built in 1831.</p>

<p>With the estate of William Ryder Drew, some interesting
incidents are associated beyond the memory of most of my
readers. It was from his marriage in 1789 to his death in
1840, the residence of Barnabas Hedge, whom I remember
well. He was the last man in Plymouth to wear small clothes,
in winter with boots and tassels, and in summer with buckled
shoes. I remember only two gentlemen in Boston, Nathaniel
Goddard, who lived on Summer street, and a gentleman at
the south end, whose name was Wheeler, who wore small
clothes as long as Mr. Hedge. I am glad to see some indications
of a return of a fashion too handsome and becoming
to have been permitted to go out. Mr. Hedge was one of the
founders of the Plymouth Bank in 1803, a Director from that
date, and President from 1826 until his death in 1840. The
house in question remained in the possession of the Hedge
family until 1854, when it was sold to Zaben Olney.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the celebration on
the first of August, 1853, of the anniversary of the departure
of the Pilgrims from Delfthaven, was the visit of the New
York Light Guard with Dodsworth’s band to Plymouth, and
their participation in the parade of the day. As the Hedge
house was then unoccupied it was made their headquarters.
The celebration took place on Monday, and the arrival of the
Light Guard, Sunday afternoon, and their march through
Court and Main and Leyden streets presented a spectacle
which so far as known, caused no protest from the spirits of
the Pilgrims against such an unusual observance of the Lord’s
Day. Though I was Chief Marshal of the celebration, I have
no knowledge of the ceremonies at the headquarters, but as
the commander had a chaplain on his staff, it is to be presumed
that they were interesting and appropriate. Before the sale
of the house to Mr. Drew in 1858, Mr. Olney occupied it for
a short time as a hotel, which during the winter months when
the Samoset was closed, as was the custom in its earlier years,
was well patronized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Of the occupants of the houses not yet referred to on the
south side of Leyden street at various times within my memory,
the first to be mentioned is Robert Roberts, who built the
house on the brow of the hill, now owned by Wm. S. Robbins.
Mr. Roberts was for many years a substantial merchant, engaged
in navigation and foreign trade, and was one of the
founders of the Plymouth Bank, of whose Board of Directors
he was a member from the time of its organization in 1803,
to his death in 1825. His sister Mary married John Clark,
whose daughter, Eliza Haley Clark, occupied the house in
question many years, and died December 23, 1882. I remember
hearing when young a story about the source of a part of
Mr. Roberts’s wealth which may have been, like so many stories
about others, without any foundation in fact. The story was
that one of his vessels, either under command of himself or of
another, was in a French port at one period of the French
revolution and had taken on board the wealth of some refugees
who had planned to escape from the persecution of the
revolutionists, and sail for America, but that they were arrested
and guillotined, and that their property never claimed
by its owners, fell into the possession of Capt. Roberts and
other owners of his vessel.</p>

<p>The only change within my recollection in the occupation
of the next house, which has been for many years in the possession
and occupancy of Salisbury Jackson, and his children
and grandchildren, was the conversion in 1835 of one of the
rooms on the street floor by Mr. Jackson into a store, which he
opened in that year after having occupied for some years a
store in the Witherill building on the corner of Main street
and Town Square. In later years the store was abandoned,
and the building restored to its original condition. I associate
an old lady by the name of Johnson, who I think about 1830
occupied one or two rooms in the Jackson house, with a bonnet
called the Navarino bonnet, which had a great run for a
time among females everywhere, old and young. I wonder if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
any of my readers remember as I do the Navarino bonnet?
The battle of Navarino, which secured Greek independence,
was fought October 20, 1827, in which the Turkish and Egyptian
navies were destroyed by the combined fleets of England,
Russia and France, and so great an interest was felt at that
time in Greek affairs that some ingenious originator of fashion
invented a bonnet made of paper resembling cloth, and of the
prevailing shape, with a crown a little turned up behind, and
a front, which entirely concealed the face and chin from a side
view, to which in order to attract attention and sales he gave
the name of the battle. Every woman bought one, and every
woman wore one, the streets were full of them, and in the
meeting houses they were in their glory. But alas, they were
fair weather bonnets, and like the feathers of a rooster, wore
a most bedraggled and flopping appearance when exposed to
the rain. The fashion was short lived, and went out like that
of hoop skirts, as rapidly as it came in, while the world still
wonders what became of them. If any one of my readers has
one of these relics of bygone days, I would be glad to have it
to help my memory in recalling the appearance of my sisters,
when one day they reached home in a drenching rain.</p>

<p>Of Capt. James Bartlett, the occupant of the next house
west of the Jackson house from 1801 to his death in 1840,
and of Leander Lovell, his son-in-law, the next occupant, by
whose heirs it was sold in 1880, to recent owners, mention has
been made in previous chapters.</p>

<p>The site of the next house, owned and occupied by Mr. Wm.
H. H. Weston, is an especially interesting one. For its early
history, which it is unnecessary to repeat, my readers are referred
to page 164 of the first part of “Ancient Landmarks of
Plymouth.” On that spot James Cole kept an ordinary, for
which he was licensed in 1645. Judge Samuel Sewall refers
to it in his diary under date of March 8, 1698, in which occurs
the following entry: “Got to Plymouth about noon, I lodge
at Cole’s; the house was built by Governor Winslow, and is
the oldest in Plymouth.” The present house was built in 1807
by General Nathaniel Goodwin, and was occupied by him
until his death, March 8, 1819. In 1827 it was sold by his
heirs to Thomas Russell, who made it his residence until his
death, September 25, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>General Goodwin was born in Plymouth in 1749, and while
engaged many years in iron manufactures, was more widely
known as an officer in the militia and military superintendent
for Plymouth county during the revolution. In the latter capacity
he kept a record of enlistments in many of the towns
in the county, including Plymouth and Kingston, which is
more complete than the lists in the archives of the Commonwealth.
This record was given to me some years ago by his
grandson, the late Captain Nathaniel Goodwin, and has been
given by me to the Pilgrim Society. After the battle of Saratoga,
fought on the 7th of October, 1777, General Burgoyne
and his army taken prisoners of war by General Gates, were
marched to Cambridge and placed in barracks on Winter and
Prospect hills, while Burgoyne himself was quartered in the
Borland house in that town. General Goodwin was detailed
under General Heath to command the guard having charge
of the prisoners, and the following Plymouth men were enlisted
to form a part of the guard:</p>

<p>General Goodwin and General Burgoyne became friends,
and as a memento of their friendship, Burgoyne gave to General
Goodwin his rapier, which was also given to me by his
grandson, and is now a loan from me in the cabinet of the
Pilgrim Society. General Goodwin was like Mr. Roberts and
Mr. Hedge, an original subscriber to stock in the Plymouth
Bank in 1803, and was a Director from the date of its organization
until his death in 1819.</p>

<p>General Goodwin, I have always heard, was a man of fine
figure and bearing, and vain of his appearance, especially when
in uniform. His grandson, Capt. Nathaniel Goodwin, told me
the following story about him and his negro servant Pompey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
a freed slave, which illustrates the familiarity of the slaves
with their old masters and the characteristic vanity of the General.
One muster day morning the General, wearing his regimentals,
said: “Pompey, how do I look?” “You look like a
lion, massa.” “Lion, Pompey; you never saw a lion.” “Yes I
have, massa; massa Davis hab got one.” “That isn’t a lion,
you fool, that is a jackass.” “I don’t care, massa, you look
just like dat er animal.”</p>

<p>Thomas Russell, who bought the above mentioned Goodwin
house in 1827, and occupied it until his death, was a brother
of Captain John Russell, mentioned in a previous chapter as
an enterprising ship owner, and married in 1814 Mary Ann,
daughter of William Goodwin, and their children were Elizabeth,
born in 1815, Lydia Cushing, 1817, who married Hon.
Wm. Whiting; Mary, who married Benjamin Marston Watson
of Plymouth; William Goodwin, 1821, Thomas, 1825, and
Jane Frances, who married Abraham Firth of Boston. Of
these children Mrs. Watson alone survives. Mr. Russell was
for many years the treasurer and manager of the Cotton Mill
at Eel River, established in 1812. After his retirement from
that position, he was often the trusted adviser in the settlement
of estates, and in 1837 Mr. Barnabas Hedge, supposing
himself seriously involved in the liabilities of the Tremont
Iron Works in Wareham, in which he was largely interested,
made an assignment to his son-in-law, Charles H. Warren
and Mr. Russell for the security of his indebtedness. Mr.
Hedge was, however, under the management of his assignees
extricated from his embarrassments, and was left with a handsome
fortune. In accordance with the provisions of law then
in force, Mr. Russell was chosen by the legislature in 1842
Treasurer and Receiver General of the Commonwealth, and
again in 1844. It is worthy of mention that within eighty-five
years from the adoption of the constitution in 1780 to 1865
three citizens of Plymouth should have served as treasurer
during a period of fourteen years. These were Thomas Davis,
from 1792 to 1797, Thomas Russell in 1842 and 1844, and
Jacob H. Loud in 1853 and 1854, and from 1866 to 1871. If
the term of Hon. Nahum Mitchell of East Bridgewater of five
years from 1822 to 1827 be added, the county of Plymouth
was represented in the treasurer’s office more than a quarter
of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The various occupants of the site on which the Baptist
church stands, are deserving of notice. The house, taken
down when the church was erected in 1865, was built in 1703
by Dr. Francis LeBaron, who was a passenger in a French
vessel wrecked on Cape Cod in 1694, and settled in Plymouth.
A family tradition says that he was a Roman Catholic, and
was buried with a cross on his breast, but Mrs. James Humphrey
of New York told me that her grandmother, Elizabeth
wife of Ammi Ruhama Robbins of Norfolk, Conn., who was
a granddaughter of Dr. LeBaron, told her that the Doctor was
a Huguenot. It is a singular fact that one hundred years later
in 1794 or 1795, another French vessel was wrecked on Cape
Cod, on which there was a passenger named LeBaron, whose
descendants are living in one or more of the southern states.
From Francis LeBaron the house descended to his son, Dr.
Lazarus LeBaron, who sold it in 1765 to Nathaniel Goodwin,
the husband of his daughter, Lydia. From Nathaniel Goodwin
it descended to his son, General Nathaniel Goodwin,
who occupied it until, in 1807, he built and occupied
the W. H. H. Weston house. The General leased
the house to John Bartlett and William White, who
occupied it as a tavern. I have no knowledge as to who
John Bartlett was, but William White came from New Bedford,
having married Fanny Gibbs of Wareham, and was the
father of Arabella White, who married the late Capt. Nathaniel
Goodwin. I have no means of knowing precisely when Bartlett
and White terminated their lease, but it is certain that in
October, 1818, John H. Bradford kept a tavern in the house,
as on the 9th of that month George Cooper, clerk of the Standish
Guards, notified the members of the company to meet on
the 21st at the house of John H. Bradford. At first the tavern
was called as above, “the house of John H. Bradford,” but later
it came to be called Bradford’s Tavern, and was so called until
it was sold in 1857. It was a stately mansion. Its broad
front, its spacious doorway, its broad hall, and its large wainscotted
rooms, told the story of its ancient grandeur. There
the “daughters of Lazarus” reigned as queens, and the fashion
of the town engaged in the minuet of the olden time.</p>

<p>John Howland Bradford, or Uncle Johnny, as he was affectionately
called, the landlord during a period of forty years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
perhaps more widely known than any landlord of his time,
was born in Plymouth, July 14, 1780, and never married. He
was an interesting character, such as only an old New England
town could produce, with only an ordinary public school education,
but under the moral influences of an enlightened Christian
home, he grew into manhood with habits of truth, industry,
kindness of heart, and correct living, which no worldly
influences could weaken. No better man has within my observation
ever lived. His sphere of life was narrow, but he
filled it full. Let every man do this and the machinery of
social life will run without friction or jar. I never knew of
his attendance at any church, and I do not believe that any
theological question ever presented itself to his mind. His
character, however, was such as Christianity seeks to form,
and as long as it is formed, it is not worth while to ask whether
it be the result of the lessons of Christianity acting directly
on the man, or on those under whose ministrations his habits
have been formed. When he died, December 7, 1863, we may
be sure that the promise made to the pure in heart was kept
that “they shall see God.”</p>

<p>The hostess of Bradford’s Tavern was Mrs. Abigail (Leonard)
Hollis, wife of Henry Hollis and daughter of
Thomas Leonard, of Plymouth. Mr. Hollis came from
Weymouth and married his wife in 1819. He died
March 9, 1838, and his widow died September 27, 1859.
Two of their children were John Henry, a merchant in
New York at the time of his death, and our late townsman,
William T. Hollis. I have no recollection of Mr. Hollis, or
his occupation, but I have no doubt that he was connected
in some capacity with the tavern. His wife was a strong
minded, vigorous woman, and was the mainstay in everything
connected with the domestic concerns of the house. Her oldest
son, John Henry, was my schoolmate in the High school,
and I can testify to the care she bestowed on his moral and
intellectual instruction. The inscription on her gravestone:</p>

<p>“Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die,”
was not only intended as the statement of a general truth,
but also as a recognition of its truth as specially applicable to
her.</p>

<p>Among the guests at Bradford’s Tavern the memory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
some lingers in my mind. When I was quite young, perhaps
about the year 1830, a stranger arrived at the tavern on the
evening stage from Boston, who was destined to keep the
tongue of gossip wagging for some time. He was somewhat
portly, but moderate in height, and dressed in linen and broadcloth
of immaculate neatness and fashionable in style. His
name was Surrey, but the register contained no place of residence.
Occasional visitors for a day or two were not uncommon,
and excited no remark, but when this stranger remained
for a week or more with neither acquaintance nor business to
protract his stay, the gossips began to wonder who he was,
whence he came, to what nationality he belonged, and what the
purpose of his visit could be. In suitable weather he took his
morning and evening walk about the town, making no visits,
entering no store or church or public meeting, and asking no
questions concerning the town or people. From his dignified
bearing he won the name of Lord Surrey, and was never referred
to by any other name. He made occasional excursions
to Boston, where apparently he received funds, and bought
new clothes. He paid his board promptly, and his habits and
demeanor were beyond criticism. At the end of a year he left
town and gossips were left to wonder where he had gone,
whether he was a refugee from abroad, or whether he was
merely an eccentric man who was floating about the world
at the dictate of a capricious will.</p>

<p>I remember another visitor at the tavern quite as mysterious,
a man of gentlemanly appearance, who could not speak a
word of English, and who remained six months without disclosing
his nationality, and went as he came, a stranger in a
strange land. Mr. Salisbury Jackson, whose humor led him to
speak of every day incidents in a manner to amuse his hearers,
in describing a visit to the unknown, said that he tried him in
French, but found that he was not a Frenchman. He then
tried him in Spanish, but he was not a Spaniard. He then
tried him in German, but he was not a German. He then,
after failing to make him out an Italian, tried him in the original
tongue and fixed him. No efforts of available linguists
could fix his nationality more successfully than the humor of
Mr. Jackson, and he went as he came, and was for a long time
remembered as the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>In 1857 the tavern house was sold to Wm. Churchill, who
sold it to Wm. Finney, who resold it to Mr. Churchill, from
whom it was bought by the Baptist Society in 1862. From
1857 to the date of his death, December 7, 1863, Mr. Bradford
boarded with Jacob Howland, who occupied chambers in the
Witherell building on the corner of Main street and Town
Square.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Pompey, a colored servant, once a
slave of General Nathaniel Goodwin, with whom he
lived in the old tavern house. He died within my recollection,
and I think he was the last of the old slaves living
in Plymouth. I remember his living with Nathaniel Goodwin,
Cashier of the Plymouth Bank, who lived in what was
called the bank house, which stood on Court street, where the
Russell building now stands. Prince, whom I also remember,
was once a slave of Dr. Wm. Thomas, and lived until his
death, after the death of Dr. Thomas, with his son, Judge
Joshua Thomas, who died January 10, 1821, and afterwards
with his widow, in the house now occupied as an inn, called
the Plymouth Tavern. There is no reason to doubt that the
institution of slavery was recognized, and as firmly upheld in
Plymouth as in other considerable towns in the northern
states. So far as the slave trade was concerned, though it
was abolished by an act of Congress in 1808, there is reason to
believe that in the town of Bristol, R. I., within the limits of
the original Plymouth Colony, until by a Royal Commission
in 1751, that town was taken from Massachusetts and added
to Rhode Island, it was pursued until 1820. In that year Congress
declared the trade to be piracy, and Captain Nathaniel
Gordon, engaged in the trade, was in November, 1861, convicted
and executed in New York. It was the generally entertained
belief that one or more citizens of Bristol were engaged in
the trade, which led Mr. Webster to make the following denunciatory
reference to the trade in his memorable oration
delivered in Plymouth on the celebration in 1820 of the anniversary
of the Landing of the Pilgrims. “It is not fit that the
land of the Pilgrims should bear the shame longer. I hear
the sound of the hammer; I see the smoke of the furnace where
manacles and fetters are still forged for human limbs. I see
the visages of those who by stealth and midnight labor in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
work of hell foul and dark, as may become the artificers of
such instruments of misery and tortures. Let that spot be
purified, or let it cease to be of New England. Let it be purified
or let it be set aside from the Christian world; let it be
put out of the circle of human sympathies and human regards,
and let civilized man henceforth have no communion with it.”</p>

<p>Slavery existed in Massachusetts until the adoption of its
constitution on the 15th of June, 1780. Article first of the
“declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth”
declared as follows: “All men are born free and
equal, and have certain natural, essential and unalienable
rights, among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying
and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing
and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and
obtaining their safety and happiness.”</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the intent of the framers of the
constitution in constructing the above article, the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts decided as early as 1781 in the case
of Walker vs. Jennison that slavery was abolished in Massachusetts
by the declaration of rights, and that decision has
been repeatedly confirmed by later ones. But singularly
enough, notwithstanding these decisions a slave was sold by
auction in Cambridge as late as 1793. Precisely how many
slaves there were in Plymouth when the constitution was
adopted, I have no means of knowing, but it is certain that, as
elsewhere at the North where soil and climate and public
opinion were unfavorable, the number had been for some years
gradually lessening. The growth of slavery at the south was
however astonishing. It has been estimated that at various
times forty million slaves were taken from the shores of
Africa, and at the first census in 1790, there were 697,897
slaves in the United States. This number increased to 893,041
in 1800, to 1,191,369 in 1810, to 1,538,022 in 1820, to 2,009,043
in 1830, to 2,487,455 in 1840, to 3,204,313 in 1850,
and to 3,953,760 in 1860.</p>

<p>I have seen an assessor’s record for the year 1740, which
states that in that year there were thirty-two slaves in Plymouth
between the ages of twelve and fifty, from which it may
be fair to assume that there were at least fifty of all ages.
The following were the owners in the above year:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Robert Brown, one; Samuel Bartlett, one; Timothy Trent,
one; James Hovey, one; Hannah Jackson, one; Samuel Kempton,
one; Isaac Lothrop, four; Thomas Jackson, two; Lazarus
LeBaron, two; John Murdock, one; Thomas Murdock, one;
Job Morton, one; Ebenezer Spooner, one; Haviland Torrey,
one; David Turner, one; James Warren, one; John Watson,
one; James Warren, Jr., one; Rebecca Witherell, one; Seth
Barnes, one; John Bartlett, one; Stephen Churchill, one; Wm.
Clark, one; Nathaniel Foster, two; Sarah Little, one; Joseph
Bartlett, one.</p>

<p>The following slaves are mentioned in the town records at
various dates:</p>

<p>Cæsar, Hester, Eunice, Philip and Esther, slaves of Edward
Winslow in 1768; Cato and Jesse, slaves of John Foster
in 1731; Britain, slave of John Winslow in 1762; Cuffee, slave
of Isaac Lothrop in 1768; Nanny, slave of Samuel Bartlett in
1738; Hannah, slave of James Hovey in 1762; Cuffee, slave
of George Watson in 1768; Dick, slave of Nathaniel Thomas
in 1731; Phebe, slave of Haviland Torrey in 1731; Dolphin,
slave of Nathaniel Thomas in 1731; Flora, slave of Priscilla
Watson in 1731; Eseck, slave of George Watson in 1757;
Rose, slave of William Clark in 1757; Prince, slave of Wm.
Thomas in 1771; Plymouth, slave of Thomas Davis in 1753;
Nannie, slave of Deacon Foster in 1741; Jane, slave of Thomas
Jackson in 1760; Jack, slave of Thomas Holmes in 1739;
Patience, slave of Barnabas Churchill in 1739; Pero and Hannah,
slaves of John Murdock in 1756; Quamony, slave of
Josiah Cotton in 1732; Kate, slave of John Murdock in 1732;
Quash, slave of Lazarus LeBaron in 1756; Phillis, slave of
Theophilus Cotton in 1751; Silas, slave of Daniel Diman in
1772; Venus, slave of Elizabeth Edwards in 1772; Pompey,
slave of Nathaniel Goodwin in 1775; Cæsar, slave of Joshua
Thomas in 1779; Venus, slave of Elizabeth Stephens in 1772;
Quba, slave of Barnabas Hedge in 1775; Plato, slave of unknown
in 1779; Ebed Melick, slave of Madame Thatcher of
Middleboro.</p>

<p>Besides Pompey and Prince, Quamony Quash, an old slave,
commonly called Quam, lived within my remembrance, and
died April 18, 1833. Most of the slaves emancipated by the
constitution, accepted their freedom, and so far as I know, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Pompey and Prince continued as servants of their old masters.
A few of them squatted on land belonging to the town of
Plymouth, which on that account took the name of New
Guinea. Among these were Quamony, Prince, Plato and
Cato, but it is probable that Prince divided his time between
his home at New Guinea and the house of his old master, where
I remember him a faithful servant of the widow of Judge
Joshua Thomas.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that Plymouth was associated with the
first claim made on a citizen of Massachusetts for the restoration
of a slave to his master. Information concerning it I
found among my grandfather’s papers. In 1808 the brig
Thomas, Solomon Davie master, at some port in Delaware, received
on board a slave who had deserted from his master,
David M. McIlvaine, and until 1812 remained in my grandfather’s
service, receiving wages as a hired man. In 1812
Mr. McIlvaine found the slave on board the brig in Baltimore,
and a claim for his restoration being made, he was given up.
In the meantime the slave who called himself George Thomson,
bought a small house on the brow of Cole’s Hill, and in a
settlement of a suit to recover wages, which my grandfather
had paid to Thomson, Mr. McIlvaine, in consideration of the
money paid, conveyed to my grandfather the house, and the
following articles of personal property, which were in the
keeping of a colored woman, named Violet Phillips, and were
the property of Thompson—a blue cloth coat, fine; a black
cloth coat, fine; one pair of ribbed velvet pantaloons; one black
bombazet trousers; one white shirt; one white waistcoat; one
black bombazet waistcoat; one black silk waistcoat; three yellow
marseilles waistcoats; one pair white cotton stockings; two
checked shirts; one new fur hat; one chest, and one trunk in
which were the title papers to his house, and one silver watch.</p>

<p>Of many stories about these old slaves I have room for only
one. When the use of biers, instead of hearses was universal,
occasionally two of these freedmen would be hired as bearers.
On one occasion, when Quamony and Plato were employed,
they had heard that gloves were given to the bearers, and just
as the procession was about to start, Quamony said to Plato,
“Hab you hab’m glub?” “No,” said Plato, “I no hab’m no
glub.” “Nor I hab’m glub nudder,” said Quamony, “We no
bare widout glub, let the man in the box carry hisself.”</p>

<p>The house adjoining the Baptist church, now occupied by
the Custom House, recalls next to the house on Cole’s Hill, in
which I was born, the pleasantest associations, and the dearest
memories. In that building my grandfather William Davis,
born July 15, 1758, lived from 1781, the year of his marriage,
until January 5, 1826, the date of his death. He was the son
of Thos. Davis, and one of a family of one daughter and six
sons, Sarah, Thomas, William, John, Samuel, Isaac P. and
Wendell. Sarah, born June 29, 1754, married LeBaron Bradford
of Bristol, son of William Bradford, United States senator
from the state of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Thomas Davis, born June 26, 1756, was a representative from
Plymouth, senator from Plymouth County, senator from Suffolk
County, treasurer and receiver general of the Commonwealth
from 1792 to 1797, and president of the Boston Marine
Insurance Company from 1799 until his death, January 21,
1805. I have on my walls the barometer which hung in the
insurance office at the time of his death.</p>

<p>John Davis, born in Plymouth, January 25, 1761, graduated
at Harvard in 1781, and entered the legal profession. He was
the youngest member of the convention on the adoption of the
state constitution, and in 1796 was appointed by Washington
comptroller of the United States Treasury. In 1801 he was
appointed by John Adams, Judge of the United States Court
for the district of Massachusetts, and continued on the bench
forty years. He was treasurer of Harvard College from 1810
to 1827, a Fellow of Harvard from 1803 to 1810, and President
of the Massachusetts Historical Society from 1818 to
1843. He died in Boston, January 14, 1847.</p>

<p>Samuel Davis, born March 5, 1765, was a well known antiquarian,
a learned linguist, and a recognized authority on questions
relating to Indian dialects. He was a member of the
Massachusetts Historical Society, recipient of an honorary degree
from Harvard in 1819, and died in Plymouth, July 10,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
1829. He is worthily commemorated by the following inscription
on his gravestone on Burial hill:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From life on earth our pensive friend retires,</div>

<p>Isaac P. Davis, born October 7, 1771, was for many years an
extensive manufacturer in Boston, owning a rope walk on the
mill dam, now Beacon street, and perhaps was more widely
known socially in Boston than any man of his time. He was
a friend of artists, and a patron of art, whose judgment and
taste were freely consulted by purchasers. Stuart, the portrait
painter, was his intimate friend, and the horse in the Faneuil
Hall picture of Washington, is a portrait of a horse owned by
Mr. Davis. After the completion of the picture he presented
the study from which it was painted, to Mr. Davis, a picture
about 20 by 24 inches, which after the death of Mrs. Davis was
sold by Josiah Quincy, and myself, her executors, to Ignatius
Sargent, for three thousand dollars. The friendship between
Mr. Davis and Mr. Webster may be judged by the following
affectionate dedication to him of the second volume of Mr.
Webster’s works, published in 1851.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My dear Sir:<br>

<p>“A warm, private friendship has existed between us for more
than half our lives interrupted by no untoward occurrence, and
never for a minute cooling into indifference. Of this friendship,
the source of so much happiness to me, I wish to leave, if
not an enduring memorial, at least an affectionate and grateful
acknowledgment. I dedicate this volume of my speeches to
you.</p>

<p>Wendell Davis, the youngest brother of my grandfather, born
February 13, 1776, graduated at Harvard in 1796, and was
clerk of the Massachusetts senate from 1802 to 1805. He
studied law with his brother John, and settled in Sandwich.
He served by appointment of the Governor as sheriff of Barnstable
county, and died, Dec. 30, 1830. He was the father of
Hon. George T. Davis of Greenfield, whom Thackery declared
the most brilliant conversationalist he had ever met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>My grandfather, William Davis, born July 15, 1758, was
trained in the business of his father, Thomas Davis, who was
largely engaged in navigation and foreign trade, and with
whom he became associated. After the death of his father,
March 7, 1785, he continued the business of the firm of Thomas
and William Davis with marked success until his death. Notwithstanding
the depressing effects of the embargo, and the
war of 1812, from which many suffered, I have been unable to
discover in his files of business letters any indications of
serious injury to his vessels or his trade. My father, William
Davis, who died March 22, 1824, at the age of forty-one, was
for some years associated with his father in business. My
grandfather was representative and member of the executive
council, and twenty-five years a member of the board of selectmen.
It is perhaps worthy of mention that the services of
members of four generations of my family as selectmen, cover
a period of fifty-two years. Mr. Davis was also one of the
founders of the Plymouth Bank, and its President from 1805
until his death, and one of the founders of the Pilgrim Society,
and its first Vice-president.</p>

<p>Before leaving my grandfather’s family I trust that I may
be excused for referring to his daughter Betsey, or Elizabeth,
as she was called late in life. She was born in the house under
discussion, October 28, 1803, and until thirteen years of
age attended private schools in Plymouth. After that time
for three years, until she was sixteen, she attended the school
of Miss Elizabeth Cushing, in the family of Deacon Wm. Cushing
of Hingham. Miss Cushing’s school was probably not
surpassed by any ladies’ school in the country, and there a
solid foundation was laid, which served my aunt so well as
the wife of Mr. Bancroft, during his services as minister at
London and Berlin. History, geography and public affairs
were her special subjects of study, and while in London
it was said by Englishmen, that she was so familiar with English
politics as to be able to discuss them, and hold her own
with the leading statesmen of the Kingdom. To show the extent
of her early reading, when a girl, or a young woman, she
listened one Sunday to a sermon preached in the Plymouth pulpit
by a minister of a Plymouth County town exchanging with
Dr. Kendall, which was much admired. It seemed to her that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
she had read it somewhere, and on going home, succeeded in
finding it in a volume of sermons by Rev. Newcome Cappe, an
English clergyman, who became pastor of a dissenting congregation
in York and served from 1756 to near the end of the
century. After looking the sermon over and verifying her
suspicions of a wholesale plagiarism, she laid the book down
on the centre table with the title in plain sight. In the evening
the clergyman called at the house, and during his visit,
much to the embarrassment of the hostess, and doubtless to his
own bewilderment, sat with the book at his elbow, and the
title staring him in the face. I prefer not to mention his name,
but my older readers may identify him when I say that invariably
when he preached in Plymouth, as he often did, he selected
for one of his hymns that from Peale Dabney’s collection,
with the familiar verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mark the soft falling snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the diffusive rain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To heaven from whence it fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It turns not back again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But waters earth through every pore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And calls forth all her secret store.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She married in 1825, Alexander Bliss, law partner of Daniel
Webster, who died July 15, 1827, and in 1838, married George
Bancroft, the historian, who found in her efficient aid in the
performance of his duties as secretary of the Navy, under
President Polk, as minister to England from 1846 to 1849, and
later as minister to Berlin.</p>

<p>It was my fortune to be in London in the month of February,
1847, during her residence there, and to receive from
her and Mr. Bancroft many acts of kindness. It was during
the Irish famine, and a benefit was planned to be held at Drury
Lane Theatre, to add to the Irish charitable fund. There was
no public sale of tickets, but a committee took the house from
parquette to ceiling, and sent tickets for whole boxes to such
members of the nobility as were available, and to the diplomatic
corps, with prices affixed, which of course were taken
regardless of cost in the nature of subscriptions, and tickets for
the parquette to such single persons as they thought expedient.
Mr. Bancroft’s box containing four chairs, was occupied by
himself and Mrs. Bancroft, Henry H. Milman, then distinguished
as an historian, poet and dramatic writer, and Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of poetry at Oxford, but later known as Dean of St. Paul’s,
and myself. In the dramatic world Mr. Milman was known
as the author of the tragedy of Fazio, which I have seen played
at the old Tremont theatre by Forrest and the elder Booth.
The royal box, directly opposite in the same row, was occupied
by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and the Duke of Cambridge.
In the box next to the royal box were the Duke of Wellington
and the Marchioness of Douro, while others whom I remember
in other boxes were the Duke of Devonshire, the Earl
of Westminster, the Duke of Norfolk, Hon. Mrs. Norton, Sir
Robert Peel, Lord John Russell, Lord Lyndhurst, Macaulay,
Hume, and Lord George Bentinck. I was undoubtedly the
only American in the house, and probably the only one in the
audience whom the society reporter of the <cite>Times</cite> could not call
by name.</p>

<p>At a dinner at Mr. Bancroft’s, I had an opportunity of meeting
Thomas Carlyle, and I was astonished at his bitter denunciation
of men and events, and his almost brutal speech. While
the Irish question was under discussion, Duncan C. Pell of
New York, one of the guests, asked him what he would do with
the Irish, and bringing his hand down roughly on the table
he growled out, “I would shoot every mother’s son of them.”
I could not help contrasting his coarseness with the sweet and
gentle spirit of Ralph Waldo Emerson, his friend on our side
of the ocean.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mr. Bancroft I had an opportunity
of seeing most of the above named statesmen in their seats in
Parliament during a discussion on the corn laws, with the addition
of Daniel O’Connell, who upon the whole, I think, was
the most striking looking man I saw in England. During the
discussion to which I have referred, Lord George Bentinck,
who was well known for his fondness for horses, and the race
course, made a speech which placed him on the side of the protectionists
against Sir Robert Peel, whom he had before ardently
supported. Sir Robert in a reply full of sharp invective
said, “It is far from my intention to charge the honorable member
with inconsistency, when he is universally known as a man
of stable mind.”</p>

<p>After the death of my grandfather in 1826 my grandmother
continued to occupy the family mansion until 1830, when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
removed to Boston, where she died, April 1, 1847. For a year
or more after her departure, the house was occupied by her
son, Nathaniel Morton Davis, while his house on Court street,
now owned by the Old Colony Club, was undergoing alterations
and repairs. In 1832 it was sold to Wm. Morton Jackson,
who moved into it from his former residence in North street
on the corner of Rope Walk lane, where the house of Isaac M.
Jackson now stands. Mr. Jackson fitted the front west room
for a store, and removed his business in dry goods from the
building on the corner of Summer street and Spring Hill,
which was taken down about 1890. In 1851 Mr. Jackson, who
had been collector of the port from 1845 to 1849, sold the estate
to Mrs. Sarah Plympton, and removed to Boston, where he
engaged in the wholesale grocery business on State street,
nearly opposite Merchants’ Row. During its ownership by
Mrs. Plympton, it was occupied as a boarding house at various
times by Ephraim Spooner, Mrs. Wm. H. Spear and Mrs. Ephraim
T. Paty, and was sold in 1878 by her executor to George
F. Weston, Charles O. Churchill and Samuel Harlow, with
whose ownership and the erection of the Rink in 1884 my readers
are familiar.</p>

<p>As long ago as I can remember, the next estate on the west,
on which the store of W. H. H. Weston stands, was occupied
by a building in the lower story of which Zaben Olney and Jas.
E. Leonard kept a flour and grain store, established by them in
1827, and in the upper story of which the Custom House was
located. In 1831 Harrison Gray Otis Ellis, succeeded Olney
and Leonard in the store, but in 1832 gave up business, and the
building was sold to the Old Colony Bank, then recently organized.
The Custom House continued to occupy the second
story until 1845, when Gustavus Gilbert occupied it for a time
as a law office. In 1846 Steward and Alderman, who had
bought the building of the Bank in 1842, sold it to Wm. Rider
Drew, who moved the building back, and added a new front,
as the building stands at the present time.</p>

<p>In 1845 Custom House was located in a room on the
north side of the house at the corner of North and Main
streets, where it remained through the administrations of Mr.
Jackson, Thomas Hedge and Edward P. Little, until 1857.</p>

<p>James Easdell Leonard, the partner of Zaben Olney, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Plymouth man, the son of Nathaniel Warren Leonard, and
married Abby, daughter of John Bishop, and step daughter of
Ezra Finney, and lived for a time in the southerly half of the
double house, recently owned and occupied by the late George
E. Morton. Zaben Olney came from Rhode Island, and what
his occupation was before he entered into partnership with Mr.
Leonard, is not within my remembrance. He married in
1816, Rebecca Morton, and in 1862, Olive P. Wolcott. For
some years after 1837, he kept the Old Colony House in Court
Square, and for several years after 1854, a hotel in the old
Barnabas Hedge house on Leyden street, now owned and occupied
by Wm. Rider Drew.</p>

<p>Harrison Gray Otis Ellis, who succeeded Olney and Leonard,
came to Plymouth, from Wareham, but was in business
here not more than a year, during which time he married Margaret
D., daughter of Jeremiah Holbrook. He removed to
Sandwich, where I think he kept for a number of years a dry
goods and clothing store. Steward and Alderman, who owned
the building from 1842 to 1846, and Alderman and Gooding
kept during that time dry goods stores in it.</p>

<p>Most of my readers will remember that in 1883 the corner of
Market and Leyden streets was cut off by the county commissioners.
At that time the old building on the corner was
moved down Market street, and the present brick building put
up on the new line of the street. As long ago as I can remember,
in 1829, the old house was kept as a hotel by Wm. Randall.
Built by William Shurtleff in 1689, it had twice before been
used as a hotel, once in 1713 by Job Cushman, and again in
1732 by Consider Howland. In 1831 Mr. Randall occupied a
part of the house as an auction room, and in 1832 he established
with Lucius Doolittle a line of stages to Boston, which preceded
the famous line established by George Drew. The stage office
was in the corner room, and the stable was on the corner of
School street and Town Square. In 1835 James C. Valentine
had a harness shop on the corner, and later was succeeded by
Martin Myers and Wm. Hall Jackson in the same business.
Chandler Holmes and Lysander Dunham occupied the store
until the building was moved. After William Randall, the
residential part was occupied, at various times by Dr. Andrew
Mackie, Sylvanus Bramhall, Wm. Rider Drew, James Thurber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
David Drew, Isaac B. Rich and Mrs. M. J. Lincoln, the author
of the Boston Cook Book. Wm. Hall Jackson, above mentioned,
died February 3, 1869.</p>

<p>The occupants of the buildings on Market street, and the
changes in the line of the street, which have been made within
my recollection, come next in order. There was no change in
the boundaries after 1715 until December 30, 1873, when the
street was widened on the easterly side from the present bake
house south. It was again widened November 5, 1883, by cutting
off the Leyden street corner. Again on the first of January,
1890, it was widened on the westerly side of Spring Hill
by the removal of the building there situated. At the time
the Leyden street corner was cut off, the building next to the
corner was taken down, and the corner building moved into its
place. A new brick building was put on the corner with the
history of which my readers are familiar. The house now
standing next to the brick one has already been described as
the house on the corner. As long ago as I remember the house
which stood next to the corner, and was taken down in 1883,
was built by Benjamin Bramhall, and was called the green
store. In 1827 it was occupied at times by William Z. Ripley,
who kept a dry goods store, Rufus Robbins, who kept what
was called the Old Colony bookstore, Benjamin Hathaway, who
kept a harness store, and Sylvanus Bramhall, silversmith. In
1833 it was occupied by James G. Gleason barber, in 1851, by
James Kendrick, and later, by George A. Hathaway, bookseller,
and Benjamin Churchill.</p>

<p>The next building was occupied in my boyhood by Deacon
Nathan Reed, who had at an earlier date kept a store in the
next building on the south. He owned a barn in School
street, which was burned in January, 1835, and I remember that
the only house taking fire from flying embers was his own
dwelling on Market street. He died, January 12, 1842, and in
1856 his widow sold the house to Barnabas H. Holmes, who
converted its lower rooms into a store, and occupied it for a
tailor’s shop. It was later occupied by Benjamin Cooper Finney,
as a store, and in 1883 was removed to the rear of the
Brewster building on Leyden street, where it has since been
used as a dwelling house with its old front room restored.</p>

<p>The next building was long known as the Shurtleff tavern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and, before the revolution, was partially occupied by General
Peleg Wadsworth for a private school. General Wadsworth’s
daughter Zilpah married Stephen Longfellow, the grandfather
of the poet. As long ago as I can remember its upper story
was occupied by Robert Dunham, who owned a large stable in
the rear, the entrance to which was through the yard on the
south of the building in question. Mr. Dunham was connected
with stage lines to Boston and Taunton in connection
with George Drew, and died in 1833. He had three daughters,
one of whom, Mary Ann, married Thomas Long, second
cousin of Gov. John D. Long, and kept a milliner’s store on
Summer street in the house which was afterwards occupied by
the late Benjamin Hathaway.</p>

<p>The lower part of the Dunham building was divided into two
stores. The northerly one was a candy store, kept by two ladies,
who were known only as Nancy and Eliza. I wish to
embalm their memories in gratitude for the satisfaction my
youthful taste often received at their hands. They were,
Nancy, a maiden lady, daughter of James and Bethiah (Dunham)
Paulding, and Eliza (Rogers) Straffin, wife of George
Straffin. They were succeeded by Stephen Rogers, who carried
on the same business, and died, May 18, 1868. The
other store was occupied by Lazarus Symmes, who had succeeded
Nathan Reed, and who died, Dec. 25, 1851. After the
death of Robert Dunham, the upper part was occupied by Daniel
Deacon, who married, Mary, daughter of Thomas Torrance,
and died March 13, 1842. The building in question was taken
down, and the present building, recently owned by the estate
of Zaben Olney, was erected on the northerly part of the lot,
and on the southerly part the present bake house was erected
by Samuel Talbot and George Churchill, bakers.</p>

<p>In my youth a building standing on the south side of the entrance
to Dunham’s stable, was owned by Antipas Brigham,
who occupied it as a dwelling house and store. Mr. Brigham
died, August 6, 1832, and was succeeded in the occupancy of
the store by William Barnes in 1832, and later by Stephen Lucas,
Ephraim Bartlett, and Wm. Henry Bartlett. In 1827
Harvey Shaw, accountant, occupied the upper part for a time,
and in 1845 Alvah C. Page occupied it for a writing school.
The building in question was partially burned about 1870, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
taken down, and in 1876 a building which had been occupied
by Wm. Bishop and others, on the Odd Fellows’ lot on Main
street, was moved to its site.</p>

<p>This last building, after its removal was occupied for a time
by Thomas N. Eldridge as a dry goods store.</p>

<p>The next building has had its front altered into a store, but
in other respects it remains as it was in my youth, when owned
and occupied as a dwelling house by John Macomber. In 1874
it came into the possession of Josiah A. Robbins, and the store
now standing on its south side was moved from the present
site of the store of Christopher T. Harris.</p>

<p>The next house built in 1832 by Capt. Isaac Bartlett, came
into the possession of John B. Atwood in 1855, who fitted up a
store on its northerly side, and occupied the remainder as a
dwelling. Capt. Isaac Bartlett was a shipmaster for many
years, and made many voyages in the Havana trade between
that port and Plymouth, in the brig Hannah, owned by Barnabas
Hedge. I have distinct and agreeable memories of his
arrivals with loads of molasses, some of which I licked from
sticks introduced into hospitable bung holes, without money and
without price. Captain Bartlett died, May 3, 1845. By his
second wife, Rebecca, daughter of Caleb Bartlett, he had a son,
Robert, born in 1817, and a daughter, Rebecca, born in 1819,
both remarkable for minds capable of unlimited development
and cultivation. Robert Bartlett, of whom I wish particularly
to speak, was fitted for college in Plymouth by George Washington
Hosmer and Addison Brown, both graduates of Harvard
in the class of 1826; and graduated in 1836. He was tutor
in Latin at Harvard from 1839 to 1843, when his early
death destroyed the promise of a brilliant career. Aside from
being a fellow townsman, I had an opportunity afforded by being
a fellow boarder with him two years in Cambridge, of estimating
his character and learning. I do not feel that I am
violating any rules of propriety in speaking of a passage in his
career, which gave me as a young man my first insight into the
romances of life. He became engaged to my cousin, Elizabeth
Crowell White, a daughter of Capt. Gideon Consider White, a
lady of about his own age, and as remarkable as he in literary
culture. After the death of her father and mother she was a
member of my mother’s family until her death. In 1842, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
a visit to relatives in Nova Scotia, she broke off her engagement
with Mr. Bartlett, and soon after contracted a new engagement
with an English gentleman. The blow to Mr. Bartlett
was a severe one, and I remember well the visit which he
made to our house on the afternoon of the day he received his
letter of dismissal. After her return from Nova Scotia I was
not long in discovering that her heart was still in the possession
of her former lover, though she endeavored to conceal the
fact. At this time an inherited tendency to a disease of the
lungs began to show itself, both in her and in Mr. Bartlett, and
in both cases, consumption rapidly performed its fatal work.
She was soon confined permanently to the house, and he was
obliged to abandon his college work, and return home to become
like her a prisoner in his chamber and bed. He was
brought from Boston in the steamboat, then running, and she,
knowing that he was coming, sat by the chamber window on
the north side of our house on Cole’s Hill, evidently anxious to
catch a glimpse of one whom she had mistakenly cast off, but
whom she still loved with all her heart. I remember well the
tears she shed as he was carried up the street, and she saw him
for the last time. Both failed rapidly. He died at his home,
September 15, 1843, and she on the 7th of the next month, and
both are buried in Vine Hills cemetery, united at least in spirit,
where “they neither marry nor are given in marriage.”</p>

<p>It is not worth while to consider the occupancy of the remaining
estates between the Isaac Bartlett house and the brook.
It will be sufficient to say that the first building next to the
Bartlett House was at one time occupied by Oliver Keyes, and
again by Martin Myers, who kept a harness store on the
corner of Leyden street. Two stores have been erected in
front of the building which are occupied by C. T. Harris &amp;
Son, and by the Co-operative store. In 1828 a man named
Joseph D. Jones, kept a tinman’s shop on Market street, but its
precise location I cannot define. He advertised bulbous roots
for sale, and we boys, always ready to adopt nicknames, called
him bulbous Jones. He deserved a better name, for he was
one of the best of men, conscientious in all his dealings, and a
valuable citizen. At a later date he moved to a one story
building on Main street, where Leyden Hall building now
stands, after Dr. Isaac LeBaron, apothecary, had moved from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it to the corner of North street. Rev. Adiel Harvey, pastor
of the Baptist Society from 1845 to 1855, and superintendent
of public schools from 1853 to 1859, married his daughter.
About forty years after he left Plymouth I met him one day
in Boston, and instantly recognizing him, called him by name,
and had a pleasant conversation with him. Of course he
failed to recognize me, but he expressed great pleasure at meeting
some one from Plymouth, who could tell him about the doings
in the old town. Twelve or fifteen years ago I was advertised
to deliver an address before the Young Men’s Christian
Union, and the old man considerably over ninety years of age,
seeing the advertisement, came escorted by his daughter to
hear me. He died not many years ago at the Old Men’s
Home, on Springfield street, where he had been for some time
an inmate, nearly if not quite, a centenarian.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of Spring Hill there was until 1890 a
building with a front on Summer street, but there was a tenement
on its easterly end which must be considered in connection
with Market street. This tenement in my youth was occupied
by Clement Bates, a native of Hanover, who came to
Plymouth and married Irene Sanger, daughter of Thomas
Burgess, the keeper of the Plymouth lighthouse, who, because
he always wore a red thrum cap, was called Red Cap Burgess.
He married in 1824 Betsey Burgess, a sister of his first wife.
He was a caulker, and graver by trade, and in 1831 was chosen
sexton by the town, whose duty it was to conduct funerals, take
care of the town house, and ring the town bell at such hours,
morning, noon and night, as were specified by the town. After
his relinquishment of the management of funerals, which
had been taken up by private undertakers, he told me that he
had buried thirty-two hundred and fifty persons. He performed
the other duties of his office until his death, July 13,
1885. It is an interesting fact that after so long a period of
business dealings with the material bodies of the dead he became
a confirmed believer in the doctrines of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>In my early youth a wooden building standing on the north
corner of Market and Summer streets, was occupied as a store
by Bridgham Russell, until he was appointed postmaster in
1832. Mr. Russell was the son of Jonathan and Rebecca
(Turner) Russell of Barnstable, and was born in 1793. He
married in 1822 Betsey, daughter of Jeremiah Farris of Barnstable,
and died March 29, 1840. He was the second Captain
of the Standish Guards, succeeding Captain Coomer Weston.
The store which Mr. Russell had occupied, was taken down in
1832, and replaced by the present brick building, which was
occupied by Alexander G. Nye, and for many years by Samuel
and Thomas Branch Sherman. Samuel Sherman was Town
Treasurer from 1835 to 1856, serving one year after I entered,
for the first time, the office of selectman, and died October 20,
1857.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>The next building was occupied as long ago as I can remember
by Osmore Jenkins, who kept a jeweller’s store as early as
1830, and after leaving Plymouth became distinguished in his
profession. He was born in Mt. Vernon, N. H., September 4,
1815, and died in Melrose, Mass., December 19, 1904. Mr.
Jenkins was succeeded by Wm. Morey, who occupied the store
many years in making and selling boots and shoes. In those
days, especially in winter, it was the universal custom to wear
boots, the common close legged boots, in contra distinction to
the top boots worn with small clothes. In 1831, when I was
nine years old, Mr. Morey made my first pair, and if school
hours had not interfered I think I should have watched every
stitch and peg in their construction. These boots, now little
worn, were first introduced into the peninsular army by the
Duke of Wellington, and are to this day in England called Wellingtons.
Why Congress boots, which have largely taken their
place, should be so called, is somewhat strange, as similar laced
boots have been for many generations worn in Ireland under
the name of high-lows and brogans.</p>

<p>Wm. Morey had seven sons, William, born in 1813, John Edwards,
1815, Thos., 1817, Cornelius, 1820, Charles, 1825, Edwin,
1827, and Henry, 1833. Of these Edwin lives in Boston,
a successful and well known merchant; Thomas was in 1899
the head of a thriving printing house in Greenfield, and of John
Edwards I know nothing, while William, Charles and Henry
have been dead some years, and Cornelius died in infancy.</p>

<p>The building extending from the Morey building to High
street, was in my youth divided into two tenements. The
southerly part was owned and occupied by Samuel Talbot, who
bought it in 1826. Mr. Talbot, son of George Talbot of Milton,
was born in that town in 1791, and came to Plymouth
about 1820. In 1825 he formed a partnership with John Calderwood
Holmes in the bakery business in the building in Summer
street now occupied by the Misses Rich. Mr. Holmes
died May 17, 1826, and Mr. Talbot became associated with
George Churchill in the business. I have often seen the room,
now a parlor, full of sea biscuit, waiting to be packed in casks
and placed on board the whalemen. I remember, too, the two
wheeled green baker’s cart with America Rogers driving, and
the round, warm biscuit which he left at our house nearly every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
morning, the size and color of which varied with the price and
quality of flour. Mr. Churchill was a man of humor, and in
speaking one day of the readiness of Plymouth people to catch
at new ideas he said, “Yes, Plymouth people will swallow anything.
I know that by experience, for I have stuffed them
with poor bread a good many years.” Nevertheless, those
warm biscuits were good, but America Rogers’ buns and election
cakes were better. Mr. Talbot died September 28, 1883.
The northerly part of the building was owned and occupied in
my boyhood by John Kempton, a caulker and graver by trade,
as a dwelling house and store.</p>

<p>The building on the northerly corner of High street, recently
owned by Chas. T. Holmes, was in 1832 the property and home
of Samuel Robbins, and later of his son-in-law Robert Cowen.
Until June 25, 1870, its southerly end extended about eight feet
south of the general line of High street, but on that date the
projection was taken by the town and the street line straightened.
This projection was occupied in 1831, and later by Albert
Leach as a shoemaker’s shop, and still later by Eleazer H. Barnes
as a candy shop. Outside of the northerly end of the building,
was a covered stairway and passage leading to a store in the
rear of the main building in which Mr. Robbins kept a store
until his death, which occurred July 27, 1838, at the age of
eighty-six. It must have been about 1830 that he dislocated
his thigh. At that time the means of reducing dislocations
were crude, and I remember hearing in the street the terrible
groans of the old gentleman while under the hands of the Boston
surgeon, who had been sent for to manage the case.</p>

<p>The next building, which belongs to the estate of the late
Charles T. Holmes, was occupied as long ago as I can remember
on the front by Wm. Brown for the post office on the street
floor, while he held the office of postmaster from 1822 to 1832,
after which it was occupied by Edward Hathaway for a harness
store, and finally by Amasa and Charles T. Holmes. The cellar
under the post office was occupied at various times by Henry
Flanders, who died May 8, 1835, and later, by James Barnes
and others as an oyster shop. In 1829 H. H. Rolfe taught a
private school in the room over the post office, and in 1832, Cephas
Geovani Thompson, a portrait painter, and native of Middleboro,
occupied for a time the same room where he painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
portraits of Rev. Dr. Kendall, Capt. Nathaniel Russell and my
mother. His son of the same name, was a highly esteemed
portrait painter in Boston many years. The Old Colony Hall,
a part of the estate in the rear of the main building, was
through my youth occupied for various purposes. The Universalist
Society after its formation, held services there from
1822 to 1826, when their church was built on Carver street.
In 1833 Hiram Fuller taught a private school in the Hall, and
many times in my boyhood I attended lectures and exhibitions
there, among which were those of Harrington, the ventriloquist.
At a later period the hall and the upper part of the
main building were occupied by Stephen P. and Joseph P.
Brown for a furniture shop and show room. William Brown,
above mentioned, died May 9, 1845.</p>

<p>In speaking of Main street in an early chapter I referred to
the physical changes which it had undergone within my memory.
I propose now to say something about the occupants of
its houses. As far back as I can remember the building on
the corner of Main and Leyden streets contained a store in the
lower story on Main street, a large room or hall on the corner
over the store, and a tenement with an entrance on Leyden
street. The store was occupied as early as 1825 as a hardware
store by James and Ephraim Spooner, who dissolved partnership
in 1832, Ephraim continuing in the business. In 1839
John Washburn and William Rider Drew were established in
the store in the same business. In 1846 Messrs. Washburn
and Drew separated, the former taking a store on the west side
of the street, and the latter establishing himself as has been
stated in the building on Leyden street, which had been occupied
by Steward and Alderman, and Alderman and Gooding.
The store after Washburn &amp; Drew left it was divided into two
and the corner one was occupied at various times by Benjamin
Swift in the watch and clock business, and Edward W. Atwood.
The other was occupied by Edward Hathaway and
Edward Bartlett, Reuben Peterson and Rich and Weston’s express.
At a later time both stores were occupied by Weston’s
express succeeded by their present occupant, the New York
and Boston Despatch Express.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice as showing one of the steps in the progress
of the temperance movement that the Plymouth Temperance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Society in 1825 placed in the hands of Ephraim Spooner
a quantity of intoxicating liquors to be by him given without
charge to persons presenting the written prescription of a physician.
Mr. Spooner was appointed postmaster in 1840, and
again in 1842, after an interval of one year, during which Joseph
Lucas held the office. He died April 10, 1887.</p>

<p>The large room over the store was occupied as a school
room in 1831 and 1832 by George Partridge Bradford, who
taught a mixed school of boys and girls, of whom I was one,
and by Wm. Whiting, also, as a school room in 1833. It was
later used by private teachers, and often as political campaign
headquarters. The tenement was in those days occupied by
Oliver Wood, the father of the late Oliver T. and Isaac L.
Wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford was the son of Gamaliel Bradford of Boston,
and graduated at Harvard in 1825. He prepared for the ministry,
but never sought a settlement, devoting himself to the
profession of a teacher. Concord was frequently his home,
and he possessed that mental temperament which made him a
congenial companion of Emerson and Alcott. He died in
Cambridge in 1890 at the age of 80.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiting graduated at Harvard in 1833, and while preparing
himself for the bar taught a school in Plymouth, and,
like the teachers who had preceded him, George Washington
Hosmer, William Parsons Lunt, William H. Lord, Isaac
N. Stoddard, Nathaniel Bradstreet, Benjamin Shurtleff, Horace
H. Rolfe and Josiah Moore, married a Plymouth wife.
Charles Field another teacher, died while his marriage engagement
to a Plymouth lady was pending. Mr. Whiting married
Lydia Cushing, daughter of Thomas Russell, and became a
distinguished leader at the Boston bar. Miss Rose S. Whiting
of Plymouth is his daughter. During the Civil war he
was for a time the solicitor of the War Department, and published
a very able paper on “War Powers under the Constitution,”
which was taken as a guide in many doubtful questions
arising during the war. He died at his home in Roxbury,
June 29, 1873.</p>

<p>The next one story building was occupied as far back as my
memory goes by Thomas May as a shoe store. He occupied
it until 1845, when Henry Howard Robbins took the store and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
occupied it as a hat store, and was succeeded by Harrison
Finney, who occupied it many years for the sale of shoe kit and
findings, until his death, July 27, 1878. Mr. Robbins died December
19, 1872.</p>

<p>The next store now occupied by Benjamin L. Bramhall, was
before 1830 occupied by Ezra Collier, who kept a bookstore and
circulating library. In 1829 he formed a partnership with
William Sampson Bartlett, under the firm name of Collier and
Bartlett, which was dissolved the next year. Mr. Collier came
to Plymouth about 1820, and married in 1823 Mary, daughter
of Thomas and Mehitable (Shaw) Atwood, and I think removed
from town after the dissolution of his partnership.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartlett continued the business in the same store until
1840, when he moved into the store built by him now occupied
by Finney’s pharmacy in the building owned by Dr. Benjamin
Hubbard. Anthony Morse succeeded Mr. Bartlett, and occupied
it for a grocery store. It was later occupied by Benjamin
Bramhall for a short time, and by William L. Battles for a
year, when it was again occupied by Mr. Bramhall, who was
succeeded by his son, Benjamin L., its present occupant. Benjamin
Bramhall died August 15, 1882.</p>

<p>The next store was occupied by Thomas and George Adams
as a hat store from 1828 until the dissolution of their partnership
in 1830. Thomas Adams continued the business until
1832, when he gave up business, and not long after was employed
as a salesman in the hat store of Rhodes on the corner
of Washington and Court streets in Boston. He was a son
of Thomas and Mercy (Savery) Adams, and married Eunice
H. Bugbee of Pomfret, Vermont. He was not open to the
charge of promoting race suicide as the following record of his
children shows, to wit: Mary E., born in 1832; Thomas H.,
1834; Frederick E. and Frank W., twins, 1836; Luther B. and
Ellen, twins, 1837; Miranda B., 1839; Harriet E., 1841; James
O. and another twin, 1841; David B., 1845; Walter S. and another
twin, 1848, Adelaide V., 1849.</p>

<p>George Adams, brother of Thomas, removed to Boston, and
became the well known and successful founder of the Boston
directory. He returned to Plymouth in 1846, and occupied
the old store. He married in 1829 Hannah Sturtevant, daughter
of Ephraim Harlow, and had George W., 1830, who married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Mary Holland of Boston; Hannah, 1832, who married Dr. Edward
A. Spooner of Philadelphia; Sarah S., 1840, and Theodore
Parker, 1845, who married Ellen B., daughter of Joseph
Cushman. He died October 4, 1865, at the age of fifty-eight.</p>

<p>In 1835 Henry Howard Robbins moved his hatter’s business
to this store, and it was later occupied by John Perkins &amp; Reuben
Peterson, hatters, Weston &amp; Atwood, clothiers, and Wm.
F. Peterson and others.</p>

<p>My first recollection of the <span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span> was
when it was located in one or both rooms over the two stores
just mentioned. James Thurber was then the publisher, and
Benjamin Drew was one of the type setters. The paper was
ready for the press by seven o’clock every Friday evening, and
T remember well how much I enjoyed as a boy the permission
to go to the office after supper and help fold the papers. The
machine used in printing was the old Washington hand press
which, tended by two men, could print one side at the rate of
two or three hundred in an hour. Today a Hoe press is
furnished with a roll of paper more than four miles long, and
will print fifteen thousand complete newspapers in an hour.</p>

<p>The next store was in 1834, occupied by James G. Gleason
as a barber’s shop, to which was attached a small room for the
sale of soda and ice cream. Up to 1828 the barber shop of
Jonathan Tufts, which stood on Church street, where the office
of Jason W. Mixter, now stands, was the gathering place where
the gossips of the town exchanged their news of the latest
scandal. His shop had been for many years the place of deposit
for curiosities which shipmasters collected in various parts
of the world. Both the gossip and the curiosities were inherited
by the Gleason shop, and finally descended to the shop of
Isaac B. Rich and John T. Hall, Mr. Gleason’s successors.</p>

<p>Sometimes practical jokes were played in the shop more entertaining
to the lookers on than to the victims. One of the
habitues was William Bradford, a manufacturer of cotton bats,
a man of humor, always ready to play a part in any prank.
One day while Mr. Bradford was in the shop, Mr. Gleason
went out on an errand and a countryman came in to be shaved.
Bradford with a wink at the crowd said, “All right sir, your
turn next, sit right down.” He gave the man a bountiful lather,
and pulling off the towel said to him, “This is all we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
in this department, you will have to go into the next shop to
get your shave. When you go in don’t mind the old fellow in
the front room, for he is a queer chap, a little off in his head,
but go right through into the back room where they do the
shaving.” Daniel Gale, the tailor, occupied the next shop, using
the front room for cutting out work, and the back room for
the sewing women. Mr. Gale was astonished, and so were the
women, but when the angry countryman returned, Bradford
had left, and Gleason had to bear the brunt of his mischief. Mr.
Hall occupied the store until he purchased the Dr. Warren
house on the west side of Main street, which he occupied
until his death, September 21, 1885. Among those who have
since occupied the store were, Mrs. Mary F. Campbell and
Frederick L. Holmes.</p>

<p>The last chapter closed with a mention of the various occupants
of the building on the east side of Main street, formerly
occupied by John T. Hall, and now occupied by a provision
store.</p>

<p>The next store was a one story building, which was occupied
during my early youth by Deacon Solomon Churchill for a
crockery store, and for some reason, good man as he was, the
boys selected him as a victim of many of their mischievous
acts. They would, after tying his door handle, throw gravel
against his windows, throw a cat dead or alive into his store,
or capturing one of their comrade’s caps, toss it inside his
door, where a good spanking was the only condition of its release.
Deacon Churchill, son of Amaziah and Elizabeth (Sylvester)
Churchill was born in Plymouth in 1762, where he
married Betsey Bartlett, and died in Perry, Ohio, April 10,
1835. Daniel Gale, the tailor, already referred to, succeeded
Deacon Churchill, and occupied it many years. Further mention
will be made of him as an occupant of a house on the west
side of the street.</p>

<p>The next store standing by itself was also a one story building,
in my youth occupied as an apothecary shop by Dr. Isaac
LeBaron until 1835, when he moved to the corner of Main
and North streets. Dr. LeBaron was succeeded by Joseph D.
Jones, tinman, who has been already referred to in connection
with Market street. The above two one story buildings occupied
the sites of the present Leyden Hall building, and the
Hubbard building.</p>

<p>After the erection of Leyden Hall building its early occupants
were, Joseph Cushman, Alderman &amp; Gooding, on the
North side, and Jameson &amp; Company and Benjamin O.
Strong on the South side. Mr. Cushman, son of Joseph and
Sally (Thompson) Cushman of Middleboro, came a young
man to Plymouth and opened a dry goods store on the corner
of Main street and Town Square, whence he removed to the
Leyden hall building, and continued in business there some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
years. In December, 1849, he sailed from New York for California,
and became a permanent resident on the Pacific coast.
He finally settled in Olympia in Washington territory, where
he engaged in the lumber and general mercantile business, and
held the position of receiver of public moneys. He married
in 1835 Sarah Thomas, daughter of Barnabas and Triphena
(Covington) Hedge of Plymouth, and died in Olympia, February
29, 1872. Two of his daughters, Mary A., widow of
Alfred E. Walker of New Haven, and Ellen Blanche, who
married Theodore Parker Adams, live in Plymouth.</p>

<p>The firm of Alderman &amp; Gooding consisted of Orin F.
Alderman and George Gooding. They had previously occupied
a store where John E. Jordan’s hardware store now
is. Mr. Alderman came to Plymouth from some town unknown
to me, and married Eliza Ann, daughter of John and
Deborah (Barnes) Gooding of Plymouth, and sister of his
partner. After closing his business in Plymouth, he removed
to Framingham, where he and his wife are still living.</p>

<p>George Gooding, son of John and Deborah Gooding, above
mentioned, was born in Plymouth in 1822. He was my playmate
and schoolmate, and I may say my comrade in arms, as
we were members of a boys’ military company, of which he
was captain, and I was lieutenant. In our Saturday afternoon
parades with drum and fife, we flattered ourselves that we excited
the admiration of the misses in their teens, but we failed
to be appreciated by our fellow citizens, for to their shame, be
it said, they did not even offer us a thirty thousand dollar armory
for our use. Mr. Gooding married Eliza Merrill of
Concord, N. H., and died in Plymouth, March 5, 1850.</p>

<p>Mr. Jameson, the head of the firm of Jameson &amp; Co., came
to Plymouth from one of the Bridgewaters and died in 1854.</p>

<p>Benjamin Owen Strong, son of Ely and Betsey (Baldwin)
Strong was born in Granville, Mass., February 25, 1832, and
came to Plymouth in the autumn of 1851, when nineteen years
of age. He first held the position of clerk in the Mansion
House at the corner of Court and North streets, then conducted
by N. M. Perry, but in May, 1852, he became a clerk in the
dry goods store of Jameson &amp; Company. On the death of
Mr. Jameson in 1854, Mr. Strong assumed control of the
store. He later bought out the establishment, and from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
time to this has carried on the dry goods business with honor
and success. He married Betsey J. Chute of Newburyport,
and again, February 17, 1891, Elizabeth H. Snow of Orleans.
His son, Charles Alexander, became his partner in 1884. As
the Nestor of the merchants of Plymouth, I make an exception
of him among the living, and award to him a special notice.</p>

<p>The next building was erected by Wm. Sampson Bartlett
in 1840, and the store on the lower floor was occupied by him
as a book store until 1846, when he removed to Boston. Dr.
Benjamin Hubbard has since that time occupied the tenement
in the building as his home, and has also until a very recent
date occupied the store as an apothecary shop.</p>

<p>The next building was occupied from 1826 to 1832 by Isaac
Sampson as a dry goods store, and the late James Cox was
his assistant. Mr. Sampson was the son of Benjamin and
Priscilla (Churchill) Sampson of Plymouth, and married in
1822, Elizabeth, daughter of William Sherman. The late
George Sampson of the firm of Sampson and Murdock, publishers
of the Boston Directory, was his son. He died May 7,
1832, forty-two years of age. After the death of Mr. Sampson
the store was occupied by various tenants, among whom
were Reuben Peterson, who kept a hat store, Calvin Ripley,
James Barnes, Stephen Lucas and Charles H. Churchill, who
preceded D. Flanzbaum, a tailor, the present occupant.</p>

<p>A part of the store was set off as a separate room, and has
been occupied at various times by Winslow S. Holmes and
others. Calvin Ripley died May 1, 1874.</p>

<p>The next building was occupied for some years previous to
1852 by Thomas Davis and Wm. S. Russell, under the firm
name of Davis &amp; Russell, who kept a general store
for the sale of dry goods and crockery. The importation
of the Pilgrim plates was due to their enterprise. The
tradition that they were manufactured expressly for use at the
dinner in 1820 on the anniversary of the “Landing” is not correct.
Messrs. Davis &amp; Russell, impressed with the idea that
an invoice of Pilgrim china would prove a profitable venture,
ordered of Enoch Wood &amp; Sons of Burslem, England, a considerable
quantity of large sized plates and two sizes of
pitchers. Happening to arrive not long before the celebration,
they were hired for the dinner, and afterwards sold as mementoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of the occasion. They took so well with the public, and
brought such high prices, that the firm ordered an additional
invoice, which included in all six sizes of plates and the same
two sizes of pitchers, and the pieces have been scattered far
and wide, the market value in bric-a-brac stores being twelve
dollars for the large plates, and fifteen and ten dollars for the
two sizes of pitchers, while the small sized plates are unobtainable.
There is a group of these various sizes owned by a
collector in New York, a photograph of which may be seen
in Pilgrim Hall. At this time it is impossible to distinguish
the pieces originally imported from those which came afterward.</p>

<p>Davis &amp; Russell were succeeded by John S. Hayward in
1827, who continued in the dry goods business until 1831.
The store was afterwards occupied by the Plymouth Institution
for savings, the Old Colony Insurance Co., and a reading
room, until 1842, and was bought in 1847 by Jason Hart, who
moved his dry goods business from Summer street, and occupied
the store until 1856, when Leander Lovell and John H.
Harlow, under the firm name of Lovell &amp; Harlow, became its
occupants. John H. Harlow and Albert Barnes succeeded
Lovell &amp; Harlow, they in turn being succeeded by Wm. Atwood,
clothier, the predecessor of H. H. Cole, the present occupant.
Jason Hart died February 20, 1874, at the age of
seventy-one. The room over the store was occupied at various
times by Joseph W. Hodgkins, tailor, Wm. Whiting and Wm.
G. Russell, teachers of private schools, Wm. Davis, attorney-at-law,
and Stephen Lucas and others, photographers. William
Davis died, February 19, 1853, and Mr. Hodgkins died,
May 11, 1872.</p>

<p>William G. Russell was the son of Thomas and Mary Ann
(Goodwin) Russell, and graduated at Harvard in 1840. He
studied law with Wm. Whiting, his brother-in-law, and became
an eminent member of the Boston bar. He married in 1847,
May Ellen, daughter of Thomas and Lydia (Coffin) Hedge,
and died in Boston, February 6, 1896.</p>

<p>The next building was divided into two stores as long ago
as I can remember it, and the southerly one was occupied by
John Bartlett 3d, as a dry and West India goods store from
1827 to 1846, and the late Joseph Holmes, brother of Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
William Bartlett, was his assistant. Mr. Bartlett was the son
of John and Polly (Morton) Bartlett, and married, 1829,
Eliza, daughter of Ezra Finney, and lived in the northerly part
of the house on Court street, next south of the present house
of Capt. Edward B. Atwood. He afterwards removed to
Boston, and engaged in the grocery business on the corner of
Federal and Purchase streets, and died in 1862. He was the
fourth Captain of the Standish Guards, and our townsman, J.
E. Bartlett, who lives on Clyfton street, is his son. The next
occupant of the store was Bradford &amp; Gardner’s express,
which suggests a word concerning the Plymouth and Boston
expresses. Samuel Gardner, a former driver on the Boston
line of stages, was the father of the Plymouth express business.
In January, 1846, two months after the opening of the
Old Colony Railroad, he started Gardner’s express with a
booking office in the Pilgrim House on the corner of Middle
street. In March, 1846, Edward Winslow Bradford, a former
master of the packet Hector, started Bradford’s express with
an office at No. 4 Main street. After the burning of the Pilgrim
House in June, 1846, Bradford and Gardner formed a
partnership, and established Bradford &amp; Gardner’s express,
and occupied the John Bartlett store. After a few years Harvey
W. Weston bought Gardner out, and for a short time the
firm name was Bradford &amp; Weston. In the meantime Isaac
B. Rich started an express with an office in Town Square.
Mr. Rich next bought Bradford out, and the firm name became
Rich &amp; Weston, being succeeded by Weston alone, who
finally sold out to the present company, the New York and
Boston Despatch Express. Mr. Rich had immediately before
the establishment of his express kept a flour and grain store
on Water street. He died March 18, 1874.</p>

<p>Another express was started before the war by Allen
Holmes, with an office first in Market street, and later in the
old brick building on the corner of Court street. Mr. Holmes
sold to Wait, who sold to Snow, who sold to Hubbard, who
finally sold to Fowler, who had an office on Middle street. G.
A. Holbrook ran an express a short time at an unknown date.</p>

<p>Edward Winslow Bradford, the old partner of Gardner,
again started an express about 1870, which continued until
his death, December 27, 1874. Still another express was started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
by Guilford Cunningham, and a man named Cook, which
passed into the hands of Frederick W. Atwood.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Bradford, son of Edward Winslow Bradford,
formed a partnership in the express business with Freeman
E. Wells, who sold out to Simmons &amp; Torrence, the predecessors
of the present Torrence express. Benjamin H. Crandon
ran an express for a short time with an office on Middle
street in the easterly end of the building on the corner.</p>

<p>I know of no occupant of the John Bartlett store after Bradford
&amp; Gardner, until William H. Smoot occupied it as a restaurant.
Mr. Smoot stuttered badly, as did our townsman,
Anthony Morse, but neither knew the other’s defect in speech.
Not long after he began business Mr. Morse came one day
into the shop and said, “Mr. Sm-o-o-t have you any ice
cr-r-earn?” “Y-y-y-es—have s-s-ome?” “D-d-d-amn your
ice c-r-r-earn,” said Morse, very indignant at such an insult,
and went out shutting the door with a slam. The more recent
occupants, Jas. E. Dodge, who died February 20, 1888, Mr.
Richards, Mr. McCoy, Martin Curly, and Manley E. Dodge,
are well known to my readers.</p>

<p>The small store on the corner was occupied as a boot and
shoe store by Bartlett Ellis from 1824 to 1831. I remember as
a boy seeing in his store a box of India rubber shoes packed
in sawdust, the first ever seen in Plymouth, having been imported
in Boston in small quantities in the rough state from
Para. This was before the process was discovered of making
the rubber pliable, and the shoes were as stiff as iron, requiring
to be warmed before a fire before they could be put on.
Mr. Ellis was succeeded by Ephraim Bartlett, and Henry
Mills, both in the same business, and later by E. D. Seymour,
tailor. The more recent well known occupants have been
Caleb Holmes, who died June 21, 1878, Charles H. Snell, Harrison
Holmes, and the recent occupant, Henry C. Thomas,
in the market business. The room over the store was occupied
by the <cite>Old Colony Democrat</cite> in 1833, conducted by Benjamin
H. Crandon and Thomas Allen, and in 1834 by <cite>We The People</cite>,
conducted by C. A. Hack and Horace Seaver.</p>

<p>On the corner of Main and Middle streets there stood as long
ago as I can remember the Plymouth Hotel, built by George
Drew about 1825, and kept certainly in 1827, and perhaps earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
by James G. Gleason. I remember the hotel in 1828, when
my aunt, Mrs. Gideon C. White was boarding there with her
four children, while her husband was at sea in command, I
think, of the ship Harvest, belonging to Barnabas Hedge. In
the summer of the above year a small circus came to Plymouth
and performed in a tent pitched in the stable yard on Middle
street. Mrs. White’s children were going to the circus, attended
by William Paty, a brother of the landlord’s wife, and I
a boy of six years, was permitted by my mother to go with
them. While the horses made no impression on my memory,
I have a lively recollection of the monkey riding the pony’s
back. Mr. Gleason, who was the third captain of the Standish
Guards, kept the Plymouth Hotel until 1830, when he was succeeded
by Ellis Wright, who kept it until 1834.</p>

<p>Capt. Gleason was a portly, jovial landlord, who, I think,
came to Plymouth from Middleboro and married in 1816 Lucy
T., daughter of Joshua Bartlett, and second in 1820, Asenath,
daughter of John Paty. He was at different times landlord of
the Plymouth Hotel, hairdresser on Market street, barber on
Main street, landlord of the Mansion House on the corner of
Court and North streets, and a purveyor of oysters and clam
chowder in various places. He was a man of humor, always
ready with an answer turning the laugh away from himself.
In those days the price of a common drink at the bar was four
pence half penny, or six and a quarter cents, but a drink of
brandy was nine pence, or twelve and a half cents. One day
a stranger called at the bar for a glass of brandy and Gleason
in the American fashion gave him the bottle to help himself.
To the astonishment of Gleason he filled his tumbler nearly full,
and with a little water, drank it with gusto, and placed on the
counter a nine penny piece. Gleason gave him back four
pence, half penny, and the stranger said: “I thought that
brandy was nine pence.” “It is,” said Gleason, “but we sell half
price by wholesale.” The stranger took the hint, and insisted
on paying a quarter for the extended drink. At another time,
while keeping the Mansion House, a passenger by the stage arrived
for supper and left after breakfast the next morning. On
calling for his bill he found the charge to be five dollars.
“Good gracious” said the traveller, “I never paid such a bill as
that before.” “No,” said Gleason, “and I don’t suppose you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
ever had the honor of stopping at the Mansion House before.”
Mr. Gleason died Oct. 6, 1853.</p>

<p>A few days after the Old Colony Railroad was opened
Gleason went down to the railroad station to gratify his curiosity,
and seeing a locomotive on a track he climbed on, and while
fumbling about the rods and bars he turned on the steam and
away the engine went. Gleason hopped off, but fortunately an
engineer on another locomotive attached to a train about to
start for Boston, unshackled his machine and caught up with
the runaway, and brought it back. “Hem! didn’t she whiz,”
said Gleason in telling the story.</p>

<p>Ellis Wright, who succeeded Capt. Gleason, was a Plympton
man, son of Isaac and Selah (Ellis) Wright, and after leaving
Plymouth removed to Boston. The hotel had a good hall in
the second story, which was much used for dancing schools
and cotillion parties and exhibitions of various kinds. I attended
my first dancing school in that hall, and have danced
there at many cotillion parties since.</p>

<p>In 1834 Danville Bryant became the landlord, and from that
time until it was burned, the hotel was called the Pilgrim
House. Whence Mr. Bryant came, or where he went, I have
no means of knowing, but he continued in the hotel until 1840.
His daughter, Abigail, married Horace B. Taylor. It was
during his administration, and that of Mr. Wright, that the famous
line of stages to and from Boston was established, and
continued until the opening of the Old Colony Railroad in 1845.
As I remember it the line consisted of an accommodation and a
mail stage. The accommodation left Plymouth at six or seven
o’clock each day, and returning left Boston at two, going
through West Duxbury, Pembroke, Hanover, West Scituate,
Weymouth Landing, Quincy and Dorchester. The mail
stage left Boston at five o’clock in the morning, arriving at
Plymouth at ten-thirty, when a return stage took passengers
from the Cape, arriving by the stage driven by Wm. Boyden,
and the Boyden stage took the passengers bound to the Cape.
The route of the mail stage would be one day the same as that
of the accommodation, and the next it would turn off at West
Scituate and go through Hingham to Quincy, and so into
Boston. The mail stage carried two pouches, one containing
the through mail from the Cape, and the other containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the way mail, which would be thrown off at the various post
offices to deliver and receive the mail to and from that office.</p>

<p>I remember the various lines of stages running every day into
and out of Boston, and I can say that no better horses or better
drivers could be seen than those on the Plymouth line.
There were in Boston various stage houses, Wilde’s on Elm
street, Doolittle’s City tavern on Brattle street, the Washington
House on Washington street, and others. The Plymouth
stage office was in the City Tavern on Brattle street, and there
orders were left for calls by the stage for passengers. The
business on the line was good, and extra stages were frequently
required to meet the demand. It was a busy scene in front of
the Pilgrim House about half past ten on the arrival and departure
of the Boston and Cape stages, and Geo. Drew, the
manager of the line, might be seen here and there with a red
bandana handkerchief hanging from his teeth, giving directions
and orders.</p>

<p>The drivers were as good as the horses. There were Capt.
Woodward, Granville Gardner, Samuel Gardner, Benjamin
Bates, John Bates, Asa Pierce, Phineas Pierce, Mr. Burgess,
Mr. Orcutt, and I think at one time, Jacob Sprague. John
Bates was perhaps the king of the line, wearing in suitable
weather, a white beaver hat, a brown suit of clothes, well polished
boots, and neat gloves. He was no more proud of his
team than the team was of him. After the line was broken
up by the railroad he drove for some years what was called a
Roxbury hourly, running with its alternate mate from that
part of Washington street between State street and Cornhill, to
the Norfolk house and back. He always drove four horses,
and his omnibus was not far from twenty feet long, and to
reach his Boston station he would drive up Court street and
down Cornhill. Mr. Bates married in 1827 Hannah S., daughter
of John Faunce of Plymouth, but I know neither the place
or date of his death.</p>

<p>Another estimable and much respected driver was Phineas
Pierce, the father of Phineas Pierce, now a retired merchant
in Boston, and a recent member of the School Committee in
that city, and a trustee of the Boston Public Library. He
married in 1829 Dorcas M., daughter of Caleb Faunce of
Plymouth, and died August 10, 1841. His death was a sad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
one. He stopped at Hanover to take a passenger, and in
strapping the trunks on the rack of the stage he stood on the
hub of the hind wheel, and throwing himself back with his
whole weight on the strap, the strap broke, and falling to the
ground, he was instantly killed.</p>

<p>There were other lines of stages within my recollection running
to New Bedford, Middleboro and Bridgewater, with headquarters
at Bradford’s and Randall’s taverns in which Oliver
Harris, Theophilus Rickard and Henry Carter and others were
employed as drivers. Mr. Carter, who drove the Bridge water
stage some years, married in 1833, Maria Bartlett Banks, and
for many years before his death he was the Plymouth station
master of the Old Colony Railroad. Mr. Harris came from
New Bedford and married in 1835 Ruth Rogers (Goddard)
Fish, widow of Samuel Fish, and daughter of Benjamin Goddard
of Plymouth. Our late townsmen, Capt. Wm. O. Harris
and Christopher T. Harris, were his sons.</p>

<p>The dancing school which I attended in the Plymouth Hotel,
was kept by F. C. Schaffer in 1833 and 1834. There were no
local dancing masters in those days, and professionals occupied
the field, and as the lawyers say, followed the circuit.
They would arrange schools in different towns for five afternoons
and evenings in the week, and drive from one to another,
reaching their homes on Saturday. There were other professionals
who preceded and followed Mr. Schaffer, among
whom were S. Whitney in 1828, and Lovet Stimson in 1830,
who taught in Burbank’s hall on Middle street. At the rear
end of the Burbank house, which stood immediately above the
present house of Winslow S. Holmes, there was a two story
projection, the lower part of which was occupied by Samuel
Burbank’s bake house, above which was the hall in question.
All I remember of the schools in that hall is that on the closing
night of the term in one or the other, when pupils were permitted
to dance until twelve o’clock, and invite their friends, a terrific
thunder storm set in before midnight with heavy rain and
fearful lightning, which continued so that pupils and parents,
my mother with the rest, were unable to reach home until the
small hours of the morning. In those days it was the fashion
for women to wear as stiffeners in their corsets busks made of
wood or whalebone or steel, and doubtless on that as on similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
occasions, those who wore steel drew them deftly from
their waists, and put them where the lightning would fail to
find them.</p>

<p>While Danville Bryant was keeping the Pilgrim House, men
more or less generally adopted the fashion of wearing skin
tight trousers spreading closely over the instep and fastened
with a strap under the foot. The most conspicuous persons in
Plymouth to adopt this fashion were Mr. Bryant and Capt.
Simeon Dike. Of course the trousers and boots had to be
put on and off together, thus making the fashion too troublesome
to last, and by a process of evolution the cloth or leather
gaiters followed. It is as true in dress as in other things that
one extreme follows another, and so the next fashion for men
was for loose trousers with full plaited or gathered bodies.</p>

<p>In 1840 the Pilgrim House passed into the hands of Francis
J. Goddard, who kept it two or three years, and was succeeded
by Stephen Lucas, who again was succeeded in 1845 by Joseph
White. Of course Mr. Goddard, son of Daniel and Beulah
(Simmons) Goddard, is remembered by most of my readers.
Mr. Lucas was a man of varied occupations during his long
life. A wheelwright by trade, he kept several kinds of stores
later, a stable on School street, the Pilgrim House, a photograph
saloon, and last a fruit store, as the predecessor of
Charles H. Churchill on Main street. He was the son of Samuel
and Jemima (Robbins) Lucas of Carver, and married in
1820 Rebecca Holmes of Plymouth, and died November 23,
1888. Joseph White, previous to his taking the hotel, had a
stall in the Plymouth market. The Hotel was burned June
20, 1846, and Mr. White left Plymouth and carried on a boarding
house in Boston on the corner of Bedford and Lincoln
streets.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim House was burned as I have stated, June 20,
1846. I was in Europe at the time, but my letters from home
told me about the midnight fire, and about the appearance on
the scene of Dr. Wm. J. Walker, a director of the Old Colony
Railroad, in his drawers. He was occupying for the summer
the house on North street now occupied by the Misses Russell.</p>

<p>After the Masonic building, then called the Union building,
was built on the site of the Pilgrim house, one of its first tenants
was Dr. Samuel Merritt, already fully referred to in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
former chapter, who occupied the two rooms on the corner,
one for his office, and one for his sleeping room. After Dr.
Merritt went to California in 1849, the rooms were occupied
successively by Dr. F. B. Brewer, dentist, Dr. Robert D. Foster,
and Dr. Sylvanus Bramhall, also dentists, and by Dr. James
L. Hunt. Winslow S. Holmes at one time occupied a barber
shop in a rear room on Middle street, and also at one time,
Charles T. May and Lysander Dunham had shops in the northerly
Main street room. The other occupants of the street
floor and basement, many of whom will be recalled by my readers,
have been too numerous to mention. The corner room
upstairs was occupied in 1850 by Wm. H. Spear, attorney-at-law,
and the other room, together with the hall, called Union
Hall, was used by the Standish Guards. Until 1869, when the
building came into the possession of the Masons, the hall was
used for miscellaneous purposes, including dancing schools
kept by Wm. Atwood and others, cotillion parties, lectures and
exhibitions.</p>

<p>The next site, on which the engine house stands, was occupied
farther back than 1830 by a dwelling house, in which lived
on the south side Dr. Nathan Hayward, and on the north side
two of my great aunts, Miss Hannah White, who died Jan.
3, 1841, at the age of ninety-four, and her sister, Mrs. Joanna
Winslow, who died in May, 1829.</p>

<p>Dr. Hayward was the son of Nathan and Susanna (Latham)
Hayward of Bridgewater, and in 1793-4 was a surgeon in the
United States Army, under Major General Anthony Wayne in
the war against the western Indians. In 1795 he married Anna,
daughter of Pelham and Joanna (White) Winslow, and settled
in Plymouth. He was at one time in partnership with Dr.
James Thacher, and with him was instrumental in establishing
the first stage line to Boston in 1796. He was my mother’s
family physician, and I have a vivid recollection of his administration
to my rebellious stomach of senna and salts, tincture of
rhubarb and castor oil, and also of that instrument fearfully
and wonderfully made with which he occasionally extracted a
tooth. He was appointed in 1814 by the Governor sheriff of
Plymouth county, and continued in office until 1843. His
youngest son, George Partridge Hayward, now living in Boston,
was named after his predecessor in office, George Partridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of Duxbury. Dr. Hayward in 1831 formed a professional
partnership with his nephew, Dr. Winslow Warren, and
died June 16, 1848.</p>

<p>Pelham Winslow, the husband of Mrs. Joanna Winslow, was
a son of General John and Mary (Little) Winslow, well known
as the officer in command of the expedition for the removal
from Acadia of the neutral French, and married in 1770 Joanna,
daughter of Gideon and Joanna (Howland) White. He
graduated at Harvard in 1753. In 1768 he and James Hovey
of Plymouth were the only barristers at law in Plymouth
County, thus holding a position at the bar above that of either
Attorney-at-law or counsellor. At the coming on of the revolution
he adhered to the crown, and after the evacuation of
Boston, joined the British Army in New York, where he was
appointed paymaster general. He died on Long Island in
1783, leaving in Plymouth his widow and two daughters, Anna
above mentioned, who married Dr. Hayward, and Mary, who
married Henry Warren. With little means of her own, and
wishing to do what she could to maintain herself and family,
her father, Gideon White, who owned the house in question,
built an addition, coming out to the sidewalk, and fitted up the
lower story for her store. The last time I saw the old lady
she and her sister, after taking tea at our house, fitted out for
home with a lantern, which in those days everybody carried on
dark evenings, as there were no street lights of any kind. An
incident which occurred many years after in one of the financial
panics, recalled her to my mind. Mr. Wm. R. Sever,
county treasurer, came to me one day in great distress, because
he was unable to borrow at any of the banks ten thousand dollars
to meet county obligations coming due, and asked me to
help him. I went to Boston, and, knowing that it would be
useless to apply at any bank, went to see Mr. Ebenezer Francis,
living in Pemberton Square, who with Abbot Lawrence, Robert
G. Shaw and Peter C. Brooks, were the only persons in Boston
rated at a million, while now you can’t turn a corner without
running against a millionaire. “No, Mr. Davis, I cannot loan
the money to the county,” Mr. Francis said in answer to my
application. “I am a poor man. I have one hundred thousand
dollars lying in the old Boston bank, drawing no interest.”
“But,” said I, “here is a good opportunity to place a portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
it at interest.” “But I don’t like the security, I can’t put every
man in the county in jail.” “May I ask what you call good security”
I rejoined. “Yes, sir,” with an emphasis which showed
his business training at a time when commercial honor was
more potent than law—“a note based on a business transaction
signed by the buyer and endorsed by the seller.” But I got
my money much to the joy of Mr. Sever, and the obligations of
the county were paid.</p>

<p>Before I left he asked me if I had ever heard of a Mrs. Joanna
Winslow, and he was interested to learn that she was my
great aunt. More than fifty years ago he said he kept a store
on Washington street, where she bought for her store pins and
needles and ribbon, buttons and laces for her stock in trade.
“She was very much of a lady,” he added, and was remembered
by him always with pleasure. It was a surprise to him to
learn that Judge Charles Henry Warren, whom he knew very
well, was her grandson.</p>

<p>The interview presented to my mind two transitions in the
shifting scenes of life—one from the home of gentle blood to
the little store, and the other from the little store to the mansion
of the millionaire.</p>

<p>After the death of Miss Hannah White in 1841, William S.
Russell moved into the part of the house which had been occupied
by her and made it his home with his family until his
death, and after the death of Mrs. Dr. Hayward the house
was occupied for a time by the Old Colony Club, until it was
bought by the town. The little store was abandoned by Mrs.
Winslow after a few years’ occupancy, and used as a store by
James LeBaron. As far back as I can remember it was occupied
by John Thomas, attorney-at-law, who was succeeded by
Gustavus Gilbert, also an attorney, who occupied it until 1845.
In that year William S. Russell occupied it as a grocery store,
followed by Miss Priscilla Hedge with a circulating library.
Capt. Eleazer Stevens Turner then occupied it as a grocery
store, succeeded by Pelham Winslow Hayward, who had his
office there until the town bought the estate.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gustavus Gilbert was a son of David Gilbert, an attorney-at-law</span><br>
in Mansfield, who graduated at Harvard in 1797. Mr.
Gilbert came to Plymouth not far from 1830, and married
Caroline Eliza, daughter of Dr. Isaac LeBaron. He practiced
law in Plymouth many years, and died September 1, 1865.<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>William S. Russell was a son of James and Experience
(Shaw) Russell, and married in 1820 Mary Winslow, daughter
of Dr. Nathan Hayward. After the firm of Davis &amp; Russell
in Plymouth, of which he was a member, was dissolved in
1827, he moved to Boston, and for a time was in the wholesale
dry goods business in Central street, the senior member of the
firm of Russell, Shaw &amp; Freeman. After the dissolution of
the partnership in 1829, he formed a partnership with Wm.
Sturtevant in the same business, which continued two years,
when he continued the business in partnership with Andrew
L. Russell. When the last firm discontinued business he went
to Illinois as the representative of parties in Plymouth and
Boston, owners of land in that state, and after his return settled
in Plymouth. In 1846 he was chosen Register of Deeds
for Plymouth County, and continued in office until his death.
He was a careful student of Pilgrim history, and by the publication
in 1846 of a “Guide to Plymouth and Recollections of
the Pilgrims,” and in 1855 of “Pilgrim Memorials and Guide
to Plymouth,” made valuable contributions to Pilgrim literature.
He died in Plymouth, February 22, 1863.</p>

</div>


<p>I remember the occupants of the building north of the engine
house as far back as 1828. On the 9th of July in that
year, I was playing on the sloping cellar door, while the funeral
procession of Henry Warren was forming in front of the next
house. The house in question was occupied on the north side
by David Turner, and on the south side down stairs by Mrs.
Grace (Hayman) Goddard, and her sister, Abigail Otis, and
up stairs on the south side by Betsey Morton Jackson, and
her sister, Maria Torrey Jackson, daughters of Woodworth
Jackson. Betsey Morton Jackson died June 10, 1827, and her
sister Maria became one of the family of my grandmother,
after her removal to Boston, and died in Boston, May 18, 1856.</p>

<p>David Turner was a son of David and Deborah (Lothrop)
Turner, and married in 1793 Lydia Washburn. I remember
him well with his military walk and bearing. His pew was in
the northwest corner of the old church, and I can see him now
entering by the north door and marching up to his seat with a
soldierly air and step.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goddard and Miss Otis were daughters of John and
Hannah (Churchill) Otis of Plymouth. Grace Hayman married
in 1796 John Goddard, a surgeon in the United States
Navy, who while serving on board the sloop of war Boston,
died at Gibraltar, June 15, 1802, at the age of thirty-two years.
She had two daughters: Harriet Otis, born in 1797, who married
Abraham Jackson, and Mary, who married Arthur French
of Boston. Mrs. Goddard, as long as I knew her, kept a little
store in the southerly corner room now occupied by a furniture
store, which was once the law office of James Otis, the
patriot, and died February 8, 1851, and her sister Abigail died
February 11, 1857.</p>

<p>Not many years after the death of David Turner, his part of
the house was occupied some years by James Thurber, who
came to Plymouth in 1832, and conducted until his death, the
<span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span>. That paper, under his management,
had able contributions to its columns, and held a high position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
among the country newspapers of the state. Mr. Thurber was
an ardent Whig, and during the political campaigns of the
period, exerted a potent influence on the voters of Plymouth
county. I knew him well, and from the time when as a boy I
assisted on Friday evenings in folding newspapers in his office,
until his death I enjoyed his friendship. He married in
1831 Elizabeth, daughter of Asa Danforth of Taunton, and
sister of Allen Danforth of Plymouth, and had Elizabeth
1832, and in 1839 James Danforth, Treasurer
of the Plymouth Savings Bank. He moved into the house in
question from the house where he had lived some years on the
corner of Leyden and Market streets. Mr. Thurber died May
20, 1857. Among the tenants of the house in later times were
Wm. H. Spear, John Perkins, John Morissey and Mrs. Thomas
Atwood, and the stores have been occupied by Keith and
Cooper, pharmacists, J. W. Cooper, pharmacist, the Loring
pharmacy, by Baumgartner, James B. Collingwood &amp; Sons,
and W. N. Snow, all furniture dealers.</p>

<p>On the south side of the dwelling house on the corner of
North street, was a yard with a chaise house and stable in its
rear. In 1839 Allen Danforth bought the yard and outbuildings
and built the house now occupied by the post office in
which he lived until his death.</p>

<p>He was a son of Asa and Deborah (Thayer) Danforth of
Taunton, where he was born, January 18, 1796, and married
December 30, 1818, Lydia Presbry, daughter of William Seaver
of that town. In 1821 he established in Taunton the <cite>Old
Colony Reporter</cite>, edited by Jacob Chapin, the first number of
which was issued April 4, in that year. In the spring of 1822
he came to Plymouth and established the <span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span>,
the first number of which was issued to two hundred
and twenty-three subscribers, May 4, in that year. In its early
years the <span class="smcap">Memorial</span> occupied a chamber in Market street,
over the store of Antipas Brigham. In 1836 he gave up the
management of the paper to his brother-in-law, James Thurber,
the printing office being then located on Main street.</p>

<p>The Plymouth Institution for Savings, whose name was
changed in 1847 to the Plymouth Savings Bank, and with
which Mr. Danforth was for forty-three years identified, was
incorporated June 11, 1828, and on the 25th of July Barnabas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Hedge was chosen President, and Benjamin Marston Watson,
Treasurer. On the first of August, 1829, the same officers
were chosen, but Mr. Watson declining, Mr. Danforth was
chosen in his place. The place of business of the bank was at
first in the Plymouth Bank on Court street, and as its annual
meetings were held in various places, sometimes at the Plymouth
Bank, sometimes in the reading room, and again at the
Old Colony Bank—it is difficult to locate for some years its
actual resting place. I am quite sure, however, that for a time
its office was in the room on Main street, in which John S.
Hayward had kept a store where H. H. Cole is now in business.</p>

<p>The Old Colony Insurance Company was incorporated
March 6, 1835, with a capital of $50,000, and organized with
Jacob Covington, president, and Mr. Danforth secretary, and
shared an office with the savings institution. On the 2d of
June, 1841, the institution for savings jointly with the Plymouth
Bank, the Old Colony Bank, and the Old Colony Insurance
Company, bought of Thomas and William Jackson a
vacant lot on Main street, and erected a building into which
those institutions moved in 1842. Mr. Danforth retired from
the office of secretary of the Insurance Company in 1853, and
subsequently its charter was surrendered.</p>

<p>At the time of the establishment of the Savings Bank, such
institutions were comparatively new and general confidence
in their soundness had not been established. Facilities for
reaching Plymouth were imperfect, and consequently the early
growth of the bank was slow. The custom of hoarding, however,
was soon abandoned, and the integrity of Mr. Danforth,
and his discreet management of the Bank soon attracted a
rapidly increasing business. Its deposits, which at the end of
five years, had only reached one hundred thousand dollars,
amounted according to the last statement made by Mr. Danforth
in December, 1871, to $1,759,189.97, while since that
time about three-quarters of a million have been added.</p>

<p>Mr. Danforth was a man possessing traits of character
which fitted him for the responsible position in which he was
placed. He was eminently a man of a judicial mind, and if he
had been bred to the law he would have been a leader at the
bar, or a distinguished judge. No statute or decision touching
financial matters escaped his notice, while court reports, recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
or old, relating to banks and banking, were familiar to him.
During his life he devoted himself to the welfare of the institution
under his care, neither seeking office nor accepting it,
except twice as representative, and twice as a member of the
board of selectmen. While repeatedly solicited to act as executor
or administrator or trustee, he was only in few exceptional
cases willing to assume their distracting responsibilities.
Mr. Danforth’s death was a sad one. He was taken with
smallpox, and before many of his fellow citizens were aware
of his sickness, he died May 28, 1872. Death came near the
midnight hour, and before morning he was buried, unattended,
except by those who were immune. A funeral service was
held in the Unitarian church, Sunday, June 2, and a fitting
tribute was then paid to his memory.</p>

<p>The Warren house on the corner of North street was occupied
as long ago as I can remember by Henry Warren, the son
of James Warren, of the revolution, whose wife was Mercy
Otis, sister of James Otis, and who lived in the house in question.
Mr. Warren was born in 1764, and married in 1791
Mary, daughter of Pelham and Joanna (White) Winslow.
He was the collector of the port from 1803 to 1820, and died
July 6, 1828. He had two daughters and seven sons. Of these
James died young, and Mary Ann died unmarried. Marcia
married in 1813, John Torrey, and was the mother of Henry
Warren Torrey, late professor of history at Harvard. Winslow,
born in 1795, graduated at Harvard in 1813, and fitting
himself for the practice of medicine settled in Plymouth, where
as early as 1831 he became a partner of Dr. Nathan Hayward.
His office was for some years at the corner of North street,
and there in 1832 I was examined by him as chairman of the
School Committee for admission into the High School. He
married in January, 1835, Margaret, daughter of Dr. Zacheus
and Hannah (Jackson) Bartlett, and after the death of Dr.
Bartlett, which occurred December 25, 1835, he moved into his
office and occupied it until his death, June 10, 1870. Dr. Warren
was not only learned and skillful in his profession, but was
also a man of mental culture, familiar with the world’s affairs,
and decided in his opinions on the great questions of the day;
a man of moral culture, conscientious to the last degree; a man
of social culture, a true gentleman. Pelham Winslow Warren,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
born in 1797, graduated at Harvard in 1815, and from 1822 to
1831 was the clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives,
holding also in 1829 the office of collector of the port
of Plymouth, and living in the Warren house. During the
last few years of his residence in Plymouth he was the superintendent
of the Sunday school in the old church. The general
lessons given by him I remember well. They were not mere
platitudes, such as are often addressed to children, but interesting
and instructive in language adapted to young minds on
the handiwork of God in sea, earth and sky. Under his ministrations
I became for the first time conscious of a power to
think. When the Railroad Bank in Lowell was incorporated
he was appointed its cashier, and lived some years in that city.
When he retired from the Bank he removed to Boston, and
engaged in the banking and brokerage business until his death.
He married at Clark’s Island in 1825, Jeanette, daughter of
John and Lucia (Watson) Taylor, and died in Boston, October
6, 1848.</p>

<p>Charles Henry Warren, born September 29, 1798, graduated
at Harvard in 1817. He studied law with Joshua Thomas of
Plymouth and Levi Lincoln of Worcester, and settled in New
Bedford first as a partner of Lemuel Williams, and later of
Thomas Dawes Eliot, and from 1832 to 1839 was District Attorney
for the five southern counties of Massachusetts. In
1839 he was appointed Judge of the Common Pleas Court,
continuing on the bench until 1844, when he removed to Boston
and associated himself with the law firm of Fiske and
Rand, composed of Augustus H. Fiske and Benjamin Rand.
He appeared as counsel for the defendant in the memorable
trial of Rev. Joy H. Fairchild, charged with adultery, and secured
his acquittal. Experiencing premonitions of heart disease
he abandoned practice, and in 1846 was chosen president
of the Boston and Providence railroad, remaining in office until
1867. He was president of the Massachusetts Senate in 1851,
and president of the Pilgrim Society from 1845 to 1852. He
married Abby, daughter of Barnabas and Eunice Dennie
(Burr) Hedge of Plymouth, and died in Plymouth, June 29,
1874. As no monument or stone marks the place of his burial,
I think it proper to say that the bodies of both himself and
wife were deposited in the Warren tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Richard Warren was born in 1805, and in early manhood
embarked in business in Boston and failed, settling with his
creditors for a percentage on their claims. He afterwards removed
to New York, where he engaged successfully in an
auction commission business, confined chiefly to cargo sales of
teas, sugar, coffee and other importations. As soon as his
recuperated financial condition warranted, he discharged principal
and interest the old indebtedness from which he had
been formally released. He was president of the Pilgrim
Society from 1852 to 1861, and the two great celebrations of
the anniversary of the embarkation of the Pilgrims on Monday,
the first of August, 1853, and Tuesday, the second of
August, 1859, owe their inspiration largely to him. He married
first Angelina, daughter of Dr. Wm. Pitt Greenwood of
Boston, and sister of Rev. Francis Wm. Pitt Greenwood of
King’s Chapel, and second, Susan Gore of Boston, and died in
Boston, April 12, 1875.</p>

<p>George Warren, born in 1807, in early manhood made several
voyages as supercargo in the Havana and Russia trade.
The ship Harvest belonging to Barnabas Hedge, in which I
think he sailed when bound with sugar, to Russia, would put
into Plymouth to obtain a clean bill of health before completing
her voyage. He afterwards went to New York and formed
a partnership with Ebenezer Crocker, a native of Barnstable,
under the firm name of Crocker &amp; Warren. The firm owned
the following ships: Alert and Talisman, commanded by Capt.
Gamaliel Thomas of Plymouth; Queen of the East, commanded
by Capt. Truman Bartlett, Jr., of Plymouth; Raven, commanded
by Capt. Bursley of Barnstable; Archer, commanded by
Capt. Henry, and the Skylark, commanded by Capt. Bursley.
Capt. Thomas made seven voyages to Calcutta and California
in their employ, and Mr. Warren told me once that his accounts
were always so complete and accurate that he could
settle with him a nine months’ Calcutta voyage in fifteen
minutes. In the great fire which occurred in New York, December
23 and 24, 1835, which burned six hundred and seventy-four
houses between lower Broadway and the East River,
Crocker &amp; Warren had five hundred bags of saltpetre stored
in a warehouse burned, and the cause of repeated explosions
which occurred, was for a time a mystery, leading to the often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
repeated question—will saltpetre explode? It was finally determined
that while saltpetre alone is not explosive, the carbon
furnished by the burned bags formed an explosive mixture.
He married Elizabeth, daughter of Barnabas and Eunice Dennie
(Burr) Hedge, and died in New York, November 20, 1866.</p>

<p>Edward J. Warren, born in 1809, was in business in New
York many years, a part of the time associated with his brother
Richard. Of ready wit and quick eye, and with a familiarity
with prices he was one of the most attractive and efficient
salesmen in New York. He married Mary, daughter of Wm.
G. Coffin, the official head for many years of the Massachusetts
land office, and died in New York April 27, 1872.</p>

<p>Soon after Henry Warren died, Madam Warren removed
to Boston and lived some years on Allston street, but later
returned to Plymouth and occupied successively until her
death, the house on Middle street, next to Mr. Beaman’s undertaking
rooms, and the house on Main street, where the new
bank building stands. In 1833 Dr. Isaac LeBaron moved into
the Warren house, and in 1836 occupied the apothecary’s shop,
which Dr. Warren had vacated. I not only remember the gilded
pestle and mortar over his door, but also the sugar baker’s
molasses, which he kept in stock furnished to him by the father
or brother of his wife, who owned a sugar refinery in Leverett
street, Boston. Almost as dark colored as tar, and nearly hard
enough to cut with a knife, it was like the witch’s gruel, “thick
and slab,” and those who now eat buckwheat cakes with honey
or syrup, have little idea how good they were eaten with that
sugar baker’s molasses. Dr. LeBaron died January 29, 1849.</p>

<p>At various times the Warren house was occupied by Mrs.
Wm. Spooner, the family of Capt. Wm. Bartlett, and in still
later times by the Young Men’s Literary Institute, the Public
Library, the Custom House, and stores of Wm. Babb, John
Churchill, Pratt &amp; Hedge, James C. Bates, Davis and Whiting,
N. M. Davis, Edgar Seavey, Allen Holmes and Edward Baker
and Allen T. Holmes. Among the transient residents were
Mrs. Ann Boutelle, widow of Dr. Caleb Boutelle, and her
daughter Anne Lincoln, boarding with one of the permanent
families in the house. The south front chamber is hallowed in
my memory, for there on the 5th of December, 1835, Anne
Lincoln Boutelle, one of my playmates and schoolmates, died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
in consumption, one too sweet and pure and frail to tread the
rough paths of life. I saw her a day or two before she died,
with a little table by her bed side laden with gifts of fruit and
flowers, which loving friends had sent, and to which I added
my own. I never go into the printing office, which includes the
chamber in which she died, without recalling her saintly face,
her saintly voice, and her saintly spirit, joyous at the thought
of journeying home. A memorial of her life and character
was published, written by Mary Ann Stevenson, a niece of Mrs.
Judge Joshua Thomas, a copy of which if one can be found,
I am anxious to obtain.</p>

<p>The Odd Fellows’ lot on the corner of Main street and Town
Square, included as long ago as I can remember the sites of
two houses, one on Main street and one on the square. In this
chapter only the occupants of the former will be considered.
In 1829 there were two stores on the lower floor facing Main
street, and two tenements above. The store on the corner was
occupied by Salisbury Jackson, who removed in 1835 to a
store, which he had fitted up in his house on the south side of
Leyden street. He was succeeded by Joseph Cushman, who
has been already noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. Cushman was succeeded by J. M. Perry, agent, and Mr.
Perry by Henry Orson Steward and Eleazer C. Sherman in
the grain business. Mr. Steward, who previously was a member
of the firm of Steward and Alderman, carrying on a dry
goods store on Leyden street, came to Plymouth from Connecticut,
and married Bethiah, daughter of Samuel West and Lois
(Thomas) Bagnall. He finally removed from Plymouth, and
after a second marriage, died in Framingham. Mr. Sherman
later carried on the business alone, removing to a store at
the head of Hedge’s wharf, where he remained as long as he
continued business in Plymouth. He later became a wholesale
dealer, receiving in Plymouth and Boston constant shipments
of corn, which were sold in the various markets of the state.
He was President of the Old Colony Bank for a time, a member
of the executive council, and finally, until his death, President
of the Commonwealth National Bank in Boston. He was
a son of Levi and Lydia (Crocker) Sherman of Carver, and
was born in 1817. He married first Louisa Jane Gurney of
North Bridgewater, now Brockton, and second in 1878 Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
L. (Perkins) Thayer, widow of Edward D. Thayer of Boston,
and died in Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was succeeded by Thomas Loring, who occupied
the store many years. Mr. Loring was son of Ezekiel
and Lydia (Sherman) Loring of Plympton, and married Lucy,
daughter of Jonathan Parker of Plympton, and died in Boston
a few years ago.</p>

<p>The next store was occupied at various times by Bridgham
Russell, Jeremiah Farris, Benjamin Hathaway, Henry Howard
Robbins, Edward Bartlett, Reuben Peterson, Lewis Peterson,
and Wm. F. Peterson. Mr. Russell has already been referred
to. Mr. Farris was a son of Jeremiah and Lydia (Eldridge)
Farris of Barnstable, and was born in that town in 1810. He
married in 1832 Mary, daughter of Nathaniel and Betsey
(Woodward) Carver of Plymouth, and settled in Plymouth.
He first formed a partnership in the dry goods business with
Benjamin Hathaway, and after the partnership was dissolved
Mr. Hathaway continued in business, and added the business
of making neck stocks. Not long after Mr. Farris joined with
Oliver Edes in the manufacture of rivets in North Marshfield,
and Plymouth, and finally established the Plymouth Mills,
which is still in active business as a corporation under the
management of his son-in-law, Wm. P. Stoddard. Mr. Farris
was the sixth captain of the Standish Guards. Mr. Hathaway
afterwards continued the stock business in other locations, and
the first time I ever saw Chief Justice Albert Mason, he
was at a bench in Mr. Hathaway’s shop cutting out material
for stocks. Nothing in the career of Mr. Mason as artisan,
lawyer, soldier and Judge, impressed me as much as his resolve
while working at his bench to change the current of his life.
The flow of the tide never specially impresses me, but when I
see the buoys change their slant from East to West, I begin
to wonder.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason was the son of Albert T. and Arlina (Orcutt)
Mason, and was born in Middleboro, Mass., Nov. 7, 1836. He
came to Plymouth in 1853, and after working a short time in
Mr. Hathaway’s stock factory, he studied law in Plymouth with
Edward L. Sherman, and was admitted to the Plymouth bar
Feb. 15, 1860. In July, 1862, I was requested to raise two
companies to be attached to the 38th Regiment, and recommend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
their officers, and in accordance with that request I raised
Companies D and G, and recommended Mr. Mason for the post
of second lieutenant of Company D. He was duly commissioned,
and afterwards promoted to be first lieutenant, Captain
and Assistant Brigade Quartermaster. At the close of the
war he resumed practice in Plymouth, and in 1874, removing
to Brookline, was appointed by Governor Washburn a member
of the Board of Harbor Commissioners. In 1879 he was appointed
a member of the Board of Harbor and Land Commissioners
by Governor Talbot; Judge of the Superior Court by
Governor Long in 1882, and Chief Justice in 1890 by Governor
Brackett. He married November 25, 1857, Lydia F., daughter
of Nathan and Experience (Finney) Whiting of Plymouth.
In 1893 he received from Dartmouth the degree of LL. D.,
and died in Brookline January 2, 1906.</p>

<p>Henry Howard Robbins was the son of Rufus and Margaret
(Howard) Robbins, and was born in Plymouth in 1811.
He was a hatter by trade, and at various times occupied other
stores on Main street. My first recollection of him was as a
member of the old Plymouth Band, organized soon after 1830.
The members of the band, according to my recollection, were
Bradford Barnes, leader, clarinet; William Atwood, trombone;
John Atwood, serpent; Eleazer H. Barnes, cornopean;
James M. Bradford, bassoon; Samuel H. Doten, clarinet; John
N. Drew, trombone; Nathaniel D. Drew, bugle; Edward Hathaway,
bass drum; Albert Leach, bugle; Thomas Long, fife;
Seth Morton, snare drum; Edmund Robbins, orphicleide;
Henry Howard Robbins, clarinet; Albert Finney, bugle, and
Ellis Rogers, bass drum.</p>

<p>The orphicleide, one of the instruments above mentioned,
had a short career, and has not only gone out of use, but also
almost out of memory. I have been unable to find any one besides
myself who remembers it. The proprietor of the music
store in Plymouth never heard of it. No one in the store of
John C. Haynes &amp; Co., of Boston, remembers it, and the leader
of the band in Cambridge on Commencement Day told me that
he had no recollection of it. I remember it distinctly, a brass
instrument about three feet long and six inches in its largest
diameter, and with a curved mouthpiece, resembling somewhat
that of the bassoon. The snare drum, which in its oblong form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
stood the test of four hundred years, has since my youth degenerated
into the present instrument, which resembles in
shape and size a generous Herkimer county cheese. The trombone,
probably the ancient sackbut, has held its own, and is the
oldest musical instrument now in use. Mr. Robbins married
Mercy Morton, daughter of John Eddy, and died December
19, 1872.</p>

<p>Reuben Peterson was the son of Elijah and Abigail (Whittemore)
Peterson of Duxbury, and was born in that town
about 1788, and married in 1812 Mary, daughter of Benjamin
White of Hanover. He was a hatter by trade, and he, as well
as his son Lewis, who died October 5, 1878, and grandson,
William F., now living, are remembered by my readers.</p>

<p>Edward Bartlett was a harness maker, and occupied this as
well as other stores. He was the son of Stephen and Polly
(Nye) Bartlett, and was born in Plymouth. He married Betsey
Beal of Kingston, and died within the memory of many
readers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hathaway above-mentioned, retiring from active business,
became a director of the Plymouth National Bank and
devoted himself to the care of his ample property. He married
in 1828 Hannah, daughter of William Nye of Plymouth,
and second in 1857, Sally Barnes, daughter of George W.
Virgin, and died July 15, 1880.</p>

<p>In my early youth the second story was occupied by Mrs.
Francis Leonard Maynard and Dr. Hervey N. Preston. Mrs.
Maynard, the daughter of Major William and Anna (Barnes)
Jackson, was born in Plymouth in 1789, and married February
5, 1821, Samuel Maynard. She occupied the whole front of
two rooms on Main street, and one room on the northerly side
of the building separated from the other two by a narrow entry
to which access was had by an outside flight of stairs leading
from Main street. The corner room on the square she occupied
as a schoolroom, in which she taught boys and girls from about
six to ten years of age. I was one of her pupils, and must
have entered the school as early as 1828, because I remember
seeing the engines go by on their way to the fire which burned
the anchor works in that year. Among my fellow pupils I
can recall Jane Elizabeth Bartlett, daughter of James Bartlett,
who married Thatcher R. Raymond; Mary Holbrook, daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
of Jacob Covington, who married George H. Bates of
Brooklyn, N. Y., and her sister Martha, Betsey Foster Ripley,
daughter of Deacon Wm. Putnam and Elizabeth Foster (Morton)
Ripley, Priscilla and Barnabas Hedge, children of Isaac
L. Hedge, and Francis L. and George Maynard, children of
the teacher. Mrs. Maynard was at that time a widow and an
ideal schoolmistress. She was an accomplished lady, and
taught not only the ordinary branches of a school education,
but also sewing and, above all, good manners.
I carried away from her school as evidence
of my industry and skill a section of a patchwork bed quilt,
and I trust also some of the fruits of her lessons in deportment.
I may incidentally say that the wife of Rev. Dr. Mann of Trinity
church in Boston is a grandchild of Mrs. Bates, one of the
pupils above mentioned. I think that Lucy Ann Jackson, a
granddaughter of Benjamin Crandon, was also a pupil, and
much the oldest girl in the school, who is now remembered
because I recall the dinners she brought to eat at the noon recess.
Mrs. Maynard’s daughter Frances married a lawyer in
St. Louis, and her son disappeared from my memory soon
after my schoolboy days. The chief punishment in the school
was standing in the corner wearing a foolscap, and one
girl who was exemplary and conscientious in after life, scarcely
passed a day without suffering this punishment.</p>

<p>The chambers in the westerly end of the house occupied by
Dr. Preston, were reached by a door with a projecting porch
on the southerly side of the building eight or ten feet from the
town tree, which stood on what is now the gutter in the square.
The stairway from the outside door led to a broad hall above
which separated the school room from Dr. Preston’s sitting
room. These two rooms had broad folding doors which were
used when the building was a hotel, and called after its owner,
the Witherell tavern. John Howland, who died in Newport
not many years ago at the age of 97, said in his diary, “that at
the Pilgrim celebration, December 2, 1803, the dinner was held
in a large old house, in which the partitions in the chambers
had been removed to make room for the tables.” He doubtless
took it for granted that what were really doorways were openings
made for the occasion. I remember well the folding
doors. Dr. Preston came to Plymouth in 1829. He was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
son of Amariah and Hannah (Reed) Preston, and was born in
Bedford, Mass., June 21, 1806. He married a Miss Sargent,
and practiced in Plymouth until his death, which occurred in
Boston July 14, 1837.</p>

<p>The later occupants of the second story were Thomas Loring,
Augustus Deming, Lydia Keyes, who died June 30, 1873,
at the age of 75 years, and Jacob Howland, who died June 3,
1876, at the age of 82 years.</p>

<p>The building in question stood ten feet or more back from
the southerly line of the lot, while the building above it on
the square, came out to the sidewalk. When Odd Fellows’
Hall was built the open space was built upon. About 1850
Mr. Isaac Brewster, representing the owners of the lot, erected
a two story building in the yard on its northeast corner, which
was occupied below for many years by Wm. Bishop, as early
as 1845, as the Old Colony bookstore, and later by Charles
C. Doten, and above by William Davis as a lawyer’s office, and
by Benjamin Whiting and Wm. S. Robbins, photographers.
In 1876 it was moved to a lot on Market street, below the bake
house, where it now stands. Odd Fellows’ building had three
rooms on Main street. That in the corner was occupied many
years by the post office. The next was occupied by Stevens M.
Burbank, H. N. P. Hubbard, and Hathaway and Sampson,
and the third by Z. F. Leach, H. W. Dick, Alfred S. Burbank
and Hatch &amp; Shaw. The building was destroyed by fire
January 10, 1904.</p>

<p>There stood where the Sherman block stands until that block
was built a few years ago a two story wooden building occupied
in my boyhood by George W. Virgin at the south end,
and by Deacon Wm. P. Ripley at the north end. These stores
were at various times also occupied by Samuel Shaw &amp; Co.,
Henry Tilson, Wm. Z. Ripley, Wm. T. Hollis, Southworth
Barnes, Stevens M. Burbank, Thomas Holsgrove, Jacob Howland
and Albert N. Fletcher.</p>

<p>Samuel Shaw, a son of Southworth and Maria (Churchill)
Shaw, was born in Plymouth in 1808, and married Mary Gibbs,
daughter of Simeon Dike, and died May 28, 1872. Mr. Virgin,
the son of John and Priscilla (Cooper) Virgin, married in
1816, Mary, daughter of Isaac and Lucy (Harlow) Barnes,
and died April 19, 1869. Henry Tilson, who died in January,
1835, and Wm. P. Ripley have been already referred to.
William Z. Ripley, the son of William P. and Mary (Briggs)
Ripley, was born in Plymouth and married Adeline B. Cushman.
He finally removed to Boston. William T. Hollis, as
already mentioned in connection with the Bradford tavern,
was the son of Henry and Deborah (Leonard) Hollis, and was
born in Plymouth in 1826. He was jointly with Thomas
Prince, proprietor and editor of the <span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span>
from 1861 to 1863, and of the <cite>Memorial and Rock</cite> after the
<cite>Memorial</cite> was consolidated with the <cite>Plymouth Rock</cite>, jointly
with Thomas Prince and George F. Andrews, from 1863 to
1864. He died unmarried at the Plymouth Rock Hotel only a
few years ago. Southworth Barnes, son of William and
Mercy (Carver) Barnes, was born in Plymouth, and married
in 1833, Lucy, daughter of John and Lydia (Mason) Burbank.
After his death, which occurred October 29, 1861, his store
was taken by Stevens Mason Burbank, nephew of his wife,
who married in 1851, Cornelia, daughter of Samuel and Rebecca
(Bradford) Doten. The rooms over the stores in the
building in question were occupied by various persons at various
times for miscellaneous purposes. Among the occupants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
were the Plymouth Anti-Slavery Society, Thomas May, Benjamin
F. Field and Abel D. Breed, tailors, Benjamin Hathaway,
manufacturer of neck stocks, Clary and Burr, barbers,
Dr. Sanborn, dentist, the <cite>Plymouth Free Press</cite>, newspaper,
P. T. Denney, and N. A. T. Jones, tailors, Thomas B. Drew
and Thomas D. Shumway, dentists.</p>

<p>The occupant of the next house from 1828 to 1837 was Daniel
Gale, a tailor whose shop on the other side of Main street
has been already mentioned. He was a son of Noah and Rebecca
Gale, but where he was born and when, I do not know.
He married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Winslow of Duxbury,
and probably about 1837 moved away from Plymouth, as
I find no record of his death. Like all men in his line of business
in localities too small for keeping an assortment of cloth,
he was only a tailor, and not a draper. Customers furnished
their own cloth, and by an unwritten law the tailor was entitled
to the remnants from which in time considerable profit accrued.
These remnants were universally, in Plymouth at least, called
cabbage. Hence the word cabbage as applied in the sense of
stealing or, to use a milder phrase, of taking possession of.
Mr. Gale, after a residence of some years in Plymouth, built the
block of houses between Sandwich street and the Mill pond,
which in my boyhood was known as Gale’s Cabbage, implying
that it was built from the profits of his remnants.</p>

<p>Another house somewhat pretentious in style, received a
name suggested by a practice more reprehensible than one
which custom permitted. The owner was often employed as
a surveyor to run out large lots of woodland into smaller lots
for sale. In doing this work certain strips and gores of land
would be omitted, and in time sold as his own. The house
took the name of Strips and Gores, as having been built
from the proceeds of these sales. I mention neither the house
nor the name of its owner, because like many other stories, the
charge may have no foundation in fact, and I have no desire to
taint his memory. The next occupant of the house in question
was Dr. Levi Hubbard, the brother of our townsman, Dr.
Benjamin Hubbard, and father of Hervey N. P. Hubbard, the
librarian of the Pilgrim Society. He was succeeded in 1841
by John Washburn, who occupied a hardware and tin shop on
the street floor and the tenement above, many years. Harlow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
&amp; Barnes, a firm engaged in the same business, consisting of
John C. Barnes and Samuel Harlow, succeeded Mr. Washburn,
and were themselves succeeded by Harlow &amp; Bailey,
the firm consisting of Samuel Harlow and H. Porter Bailey,
and by H. P. Bailey &amp; Bro., the predecessors of the firm now
occupying it.</p>

<p>Dr. Levi Hubbard, son of Benjamin and Polly (Walker)
Hubbard, was born in Holden, Mass., and after graduating at
the medical college of Pittsfield, settled in Medfield, whence he
moved to Plymouth in 1839, and occupied the house in question
until May 29, 1841, when he moved to the north side of Town
Square. In January, 1844, in consequence of a fire in the
house he occupied on the square, he removed to the house
above the town house, where he remained until November,
1844, when he removed to New Bedford. From New Bedford
he went to Chicopee, and in 1849 to California in the ship Edward
Everett, sailing from Boston. Returning in 1851 after
short residences in Dutchess and Saratoga counties in New
York State, he removed to Iowa, and died in Glenwood in that
state in 1886. He married in 1837, Luzilla, daughter of Roger
Haskell of Peru, Mass., and his son, Hervey N. P. Hubbard
was born in the house under consideration, in 1839.</p>

<p>The site of the house next north of the store of Bailey Bros.
is memorable as the site of the Bunch of Grapes Inn in the middle
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The house now standing was built by Joseph Avery, a bookseller
and book binder, who had branch establishments in Worcester
and Portland. In school book binding his concerns
were extensive and profitable. He came to Plymouth in 1807,
and up to 1816 occupied for his business one of the one story
buildings on the east side of Main street already referred to.
On the 29th of July, 1822, while superintending the erection
of the building he incautiously stepped on a loose board and fell
from the upper story to the street floor, suffering injuries
which resulted in his death on the fourth of the following
month at the age of forty-two years. In 1826 the house was
sold to Dr. Zacheus Bartlett, who occupied it both for his business
and home until his death, which occurred December 25,
1835. Dr. Bartlett was born in South Plymouth, September
20, 1768, and graduated at Harvard in 1789. He studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
medicine with Dr. Ezekiel Hersey of Hingham,
and settled in his native town. He served his fellow
citizens as their Representative in the General Court one or
more years, was one of the founders of the Pilgrim Society,
and its vice-president from 1828 to 1835, and by invitation of
the Town, delivered the oration on the Pilgrim anniversary in
1798. He married in 1796 Hannah, daughter of Samuel and
Experience (Atwood) Jackson, and up to the time of his occupancy
of the Main street house lived in a house on North street,
easterly of the house now occupied by Miss Lydia Jackson.
All through my boyhood there was a one story building in the
southeast corner of the yard which I have always supposed was
his office. As I remember the house it was still owned by Dr.
Bartlett, and occupied by various tenants, and the office building
was occupied by Thomas Maglathlin, who lived alone. Dr.
Bartlett had four children, Sydney, the eminent lawyer who
married Caroline Louisa Pratt of Boston, and for many years
was recognized as the leader of the Boston bar; Margaret, who
married Dr. Winslow Warren, Dr. George Bartlett of Boston,
who married Amelia, a daughter of Dr. Wm. Pitt Greenwood
of Boston, and Caroline, who married James Pratt of Boston.
It is worthy of mention that three Plymouth men, Richard
Warren, George Bartlett and Charles L. Hayward, married
daughters of Dr. Wm. Pitt Greenwood. The occupation of
this building by John T. Hall and others, is too recent to require
notice. John T. Hall, son of Eber and Elizabeth (Burgess)
Hall, was born in Plymouth and married in 1843 Betsey,
daughter of Joab Thomas, and at various times kept a barber
shop, a fancy goods store and engaged in insurance business.</p>

<p>The occupation of the site on which the store of George
Gooding stands with a tenement over it, possesses unusual interest.
About the year 1750 James Shurtleff built a house on
the site which in 1789 came into the possession of Caleb Leach,
who came to Plymouth from Bridgewater and projected the
Plymouth water works, the first water works built in the
United States. The company was chartered in 1796, the year
after a company was chartered in Wilkesbarre, Penn., but the
Plymouth works were constructed before the works of that
town. The pipes were yellow or swamp pine logs, ten to
twelve feet long, and ten inches in diameter, clear of sap, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
a bore from two to four inches in diameter, and sharpened at
one end, the other end bound with an iron hoop to prevent splitting
when driven into the bore. During the latter years of the
company iron connections with a flange in the middle were
used.</p>

<p>In 1800 the house came into the possession of Asa Hall, who
came from Boston, and fitted up its lower room for a watchmaker’s
shop. From that time to this, a period of one hundred
and six years the site has been identified with the watch making
business. In 1802 John Gooding, who came to Plymouth
from Taunton, succeeded Mr. Hall in the shop, and in 1805
married Deborah, daughter of Benjamin Barnes. In the next
year Mr. Barnes bought the house, and his son-in-law, Mr.
Gooding, continued to occupy it, finally receiving in 1836 a
deed of the property from Mr. Barnes. Not many years after
Mr. Gooding obtained possession, he took down the old house
and built the present one. I remember the old house well.
The shop door was divided across the middle, the lower part
wood, the upper part glass, and in suitable weather, the upper
part was swung back. The other doors which I remember like
this, were in the harness shop of Barnabas Otis on the south
side of Summer street, the second or third above Spring street,
the office of Dr. Amariah Preston, next north of the Gooding
house, in the old house where Davis building now stands, and
in the Solomon Churchill shop on the east side of Main street.
Mr. Gooding was the son of Joseph and Rebecca (Macomber)
Gooding of Taunton, and was born in 1780. His father was a
watchmaker, and he had at least one, and I think two brothers,
who followed the same trade. His brother Josiah and nephew
Josiah, kept within my recollection a watchmaker’s and jeweller’s
store in Joy’s building on Washington street, in Boston,
many years. A member of one of the branches of Jos. Gooding’s
family, Mr. A. W. B. Gooding, married Mary Woodward
Barnes, a daughter of Bradford Barnes. Mr. Gooding was a
member of the Board of Selectmen from 1825 to 1831, inclusive,
a Director of the Plymouth Bank from 1839 to 1865, inclusive,
and died September 25, 1870, at the age of ninety years.
He had seven children, Deborah Barnes, who married Aurin
Bugbee, John, 1808, who married Betsey H., daughter of Ephraim
Morton, and became a well known master of the Bark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Yeoman, William, 1810, who married Lydia Ann, daughter of
Putnam Kimball, Benjamin Barnes, 1813, who married Harriet,
daughter of Charles Goodwin, Eliza Ann, 1818, who married
Orin F. Alderman, George Barnes, who married
Eliza Merrill of Concord, N. H., and James Bugbee,
1823, who married first, 1851, Almira T., daughter of
Henry Morton of Plymouth, and second, Rhoda Ann White of
Worcester. Benjamin Barnes Gooding succeeded his father
in business in the same store, and died June 28, 1900, at the age
of 87. Two sons of Benjamin Barnes Gooding, Benjamin W.
and George, succeeded their father and continued until the
spring of 1905, when their partnership was dissolved, George
continuing in the business. Thus for 103 years, three generations
of the Gooding family have carried on the business of
watch making on the same site, and as Earl W. Gooding, the
son of George, has become associated with his father, it may
with some degree of certainty be predicted that a fourth generation
will continue the business. What I have said does not
tell the whole story. James Bugbee, the youngest son of John
Gooding, learned the watchmaker’s trade, and established himself
in Worcester, finally becoming connected with the Waltham
watch factory. His ingenuity and skill soon gave him a
leading position in that concern and improvements invented by
him in watchmaking machinery for which numerous patents
were secured, enabled him to leave at his death a substantial
property for his widow and son, who are still living. The upper
part of the building in question is occupied by Dr. E. E.
Fuller.</p>

<p>The next house is occupied by two stores and a tenement.
As long ago as I can remember, the small store now occupied
by Mr. Loring as a watchmaker’s shop, was the office of Dr.
Amariah Preston, the father of Dr. Hervey N. Preston, previously
mentioned. Dr. Preston was born February 5, 1758,
and entered the army in 1777. After the war he lived a short
time in Uxbridge, Mass., and Ashford, Conn., and then removed
to Dighton, Mass., to learn a trade. In 1785 he began the
study of medicine, and in 1790 settled in Bedford, where he
married October 18, in that year, Hannah Read, and second,
May 15, 1796, Ruhamah Lane. After practising in Bedford
forty-three years, he removed in 1833 to Plymouth, and occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the office in question. He practised in Plymouth until
1845, eight years after the death of his son, and in that year at
the age of 87 went to Billerica to live with another son, Marshall
Preston, and finally removed with him to Lexington,
where he died, October 29, 1853, at the age of ninety-five. I
remember well the kindly manner of the old gentleman when
I went frequently to his shop to buy gamboge to paint the pictures
in my geography.</p>

<p>After the departure of Dr. Preston from Plymouth in 1845,
his office was taken by Dr. Samuel Merritt, who has been already
noticed in connection with the exodus to California in
1849. After the removal of Dr. Merritt to the Union Hall
building, after its erection in 1848, Dr. Ervin Webster succeeded
to the office and occupied it until his sad death, and that of
his son, Olin E. Webster by drowning in Billington Sea, August
28, 1856. Since that time the office has been occupied
by Charles C. Doten, Ichabod Carver, Edward W. Atwood,
Benjamin H. Crandon, Sarah Morton Holmes, and B. D.
Loring, its present tenant.</p>

<p>The store on the north corner of the building was taken by
Bartlett Ellis, for the sale of fancy goods, and for a circulating
library, after he gave up his shoe store on the corner of Middle
street in 1831, and was occupied by him many years. His successors
in the store I think, have been a Mrs. Richards, and the
present occupant, Miss F. F. Simmons both in the millinery
business.</p>

<p>The tenement above the stores was occupied until 1831 by
John Churchill, and after his death, George Churchill, his son,
sold the building to Thomas Burgess Bartlett, who occupied it
until his recent death. Thomas Burgess Bartlett married Bethiah,
a daughter of John Churchill, while Bartlett Ellis, the occupant
of the store, married in 1821 for his second wife, Hannah,
another daughter of Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>During my boyhood the house which stood on the site of the
Plymouth Savings Bank, was occupied by two brothers, Thomas
and William Jackson, substantial merchants for many years,
Thomas occupying the southerly part, and William, the northerly.
Thomas, called Thomas, Jr., born in 1757, was the son
of Thomas and Sarah (Taylor) Jackson, and married in 1788
Sally May. They had three children, Thomas, Edwin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Sarah, but I have no recollection of any child in their family.
He was one of the founders of the Plymouth Bank in 1803, and
a subscriber for thirty shares of stock, and was a director from
1826 until his death, August 8, 1837. William Jackson, known
as Major Jackson from his rank in the militia, was born in
1763, and married in 1788, Anna, daughter of David Barnes of
Scituate, and had Francis Leonard in 1789, who married Samuel
Maynard, Leavitt Taylor, 1790, and David Barnes, 1794.
He married second in 1795, Mercy, daughter of John
and Mercy (Foster) Russell, and had Frederick William,
1798, Anna, 1799, and William R., 1801. He married third
in 1804, widow Esther (Phillips) Parsons. Mr. Jackson was
one of the founders of the Plymouth Bank, a subscriber for
twenty-seven shares of stock, and a director from 1803 to 1815,
and again from 1827 to 1836. He died in Plymouth, October
22, 1836.</p>

<p>There was a vacant lot belonging to the Messrs. Jackson
with two cellars, the remains of houses taken down long before
my remembrance, and in the Jackson yard there was a Jackson
apple tree, from which in season apples would fall upon a shed
and roll into the vacant lot, and in recess there was a race to
capture such apples as might have fallen during school hours.
What has been the fate of the Jackson apple trees of my youth,
and where have they gone? It was a red, juicy, early summer
apple, a fit prize for the race, and where have the queen apple
trees gone, only one of which is left in Plymouth. That in the
yard of Wm. Rider Drew was cut down during the last year,
leaving the one in the yard of Mrs. Lothrop, solitary and
alone. And where are the June Eatings, a name corrupted into
Jenitons, of which I think there is only one left in the yard
of Miss Lydia Jackson in North street. And I must not forget
those favorites with the boys, the button pears. Not especially
prized by their owners we boys were permitted to take all
we could find on the ground. With our trouser’s pockets
bulging with the little fellows, we would find our way to school,
little suspecting that we were paying dearly for them in the
cost of a doctor’s visit, and a dose of picra.</p>

<p>In the vacant lot above mentioned, the most conspicuous feature
was a large sty in which Major Jackson kept his hogs. So
far from such appurtenance being considered a nuisance in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
those days, a family without one or more hogs was an exception.
In earlier times they were permitted to run at large,
though not within my day in Plymouth, but it may surprise
my younger readers to know that in New York and Washington,
as late as the civil war, they roved about the streets as
freely as dogs. As late as 1721 it was voted by the inhabitants
of Plymouth that they might run at large that year if properly
ringed and yoked, and hog constables were annually chosen to
see that the condition was complied with. The custom of
keeping hogs was so universal in my day that perhaps a dozen
times during the season a dealer would buy in the Brighton
market a drove of hogs and drive them home over the road,
selling them on the way. When a sale was made the drivers
would tie the four legs of the hog and raise it to a pair of steelyards,
hanging from a bar supported by their shoulders, and
thus find the weight. While this operation was going on the
drove would roam at their own sweet will, nosing up the gutters
and sidewalks in every direction. I remember James Ruggles
of Rochester, the donor to the county of the fountain in
front of the Court house, and Swift, one of the members
of the firm of pork packers in Chicago, driving their hogs
from house to house. Until a very recent date, more in
deference to an old custom, than to any necessity, hog-reeves
were chosen each year by the town, and recently married
grooms were selected for the honor.</p>

<p>The occupants of the house in question after the Jacksons
were, Madam Mary Warren and Wm. F. Peterson, in the
southerly part, and Susan, Sarah and Deborah L. Turner,
daughters of Lothrop Turner, and Miss Deborah L.
Turner, Dr. Alexander Jackson, and Hannah D. Washburn,
milliners, and Sarah M. Holmes and Mrs. Charles Campbell,
in the northerly part, until the house was taken down,
and the present building was erected in 1887, the occupants of
which are now the Old Colony National Bank, Plymouth Saving’s
Bank, the Black &amp; White Club, Dr. Schubert and Dr.
Lothrop, and the Natural History Society. After the Jackson
house came into the possession of the Savings Bank, a one
story building was erected on the northerly line of
the lot, which was occupied at various times by the Public
Library, and by Arthur Lord and Albert Mason, attorneys-at-law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and finally removed to the Hathaway land on Middle
street.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the occupants of the two houses which
stood north of the vacant lot on which the Bank building
was erected in 1842, I will state that in 1851 a slice fifteen or
twenty feet deep was cut from the two lots, including the
front yard of the Thomas house, now the Plymouth Tavern,
and enough from the lot south of it to make the present line
to which Davis building when soon after erected, was made
to conform. As long ago as I can remember, the old house
which stood on the site of Davis building was occupied by
Timothy Goodwin, a tinman by trade, who occupied for his
tinshop the upper story of a projection in the rear of the
main building. I have an impression that he was club footed,
and that he had two sons older than myself, who with their
father must have moved from Plymouth not far from the
year, 1835.</p>

<p>The old fashioned tinman’s trade which flourished in Mr.
Goodwin’s day when all the tinware in use was made in the
local shops, has practically disappeared, leaving only the manufacture
of hot air furnace pipes to remind us of the resonant
clatter of a tinshop once so familiar to the ear. Mr. Goodwin
was born in 1779, and was the son of Timothy Goodwin,
who came from Charlestown and married Lucy, daughter of
Abiel Shurtleff of Plymouth. His father, who was associated
with the earliest postal system of Plymouth, deserves a
passing notice. Up to 1775 no post office had ever been established
in Plymouth, and at that time there were only
seventy-five post offices in the colonies, and eighteen hundred
and seventy-five miles of post routes. In the above year Benjamin
Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, and on the
12th of May William Watson was appointed postmaster of
Plymouth, and in 1790 was commissioned by Washington.
On the appointment of Mr. Watson in 1775, a horseback mail
route was established from Cambridge to Falmouth, through
Plymouth, and Timothy Goodwin and Joseph Howland were
appointed post riders, making the trip down and back once in
each week. They left Cambridge Monday noon, and arrived
at Plymouth at four o’clock, Tuesday afternoon; and leaving
Plymouth at nine o’clock Wednesday morning, reached Sandwich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
at four o’clock on that day, and Falmouth at eight o’clock
Thursday morning. Goodwin and Howland divided the
route, making the exchange at Plymouth.</p>

<p>Until 1816 the rate of postage remained unchanged as follows:
for a single letter under forty miles, eight cents; under
ninety miles, ten cents; under one hundred and fifty miles,
twelve and a half cents; under three hundred miles, seventeen
cents; under five hundred miles, twenty cents; over five hundred
miles, twenty-five cents. In 1816 the rate was fixed for
a single letter not over thirty miles, six and a quarter cents,
over thirty miles and under eighty, ten cents; over eighty
and under one hundred and fifty, twelve and a half cents;
over one hundred and fifty, and under four hundred, eighteen
and three quarters cents; over four hundred, twenty-five
cents, with an added rate for every additional piece of paper,
and if the letter weighed an ounce, the rate was four times
the above. The newspaper rate fixed at the same time was
one cent under one hundred miles, or within the state; over
one hundred miles, and out of the state, one and a half cents,
magazines and pamphlets one and a half cent a sheet under
one hundred miles, if periodicals, two and a half cents a sheet
over one hundred miles, but if not prepaid, four and five cents.</p>

<p>The above was the rate of the postage during my youth, and
until I was twenty-three years of age, when gradual reductions
began to be made, the result of which has been the postal
rates as they stand today. The rates above mentioned indicate
the kind of currency prevailing at the time. Articles on
sale were priced at so many cents, or a four-pence happenny
(six and a quarter cents), nine pence (twelve and a half
cents,) a shilling (sixteen and two-thirds cents) a quarter of
a dollar, two and three pence (thirty-seven and a half cents)
a half a dollar, three and nine pence (or sixty-two and a half
cents) four and six pence (or seventy-five cents) and so on
to a dollar. Finally Mexican coins were eliminated from our
currency, and the genuine American decimal coinage exclusively
prevailed. Until the year 1855, prepayment was optional,
but with the introduction of postage stamps, prepayment
was required, and when after the establishment of expresses,
it was found that they engaged in the carriage of letters
the practice was forbidden unless the letters were stamped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
If under the old system letters were not prepaid, it was
by no means unusual for persons to whom they were addressed,
to refuse to receive them and pay the high postage due.
It goes without saying that persons known to be going to
Boston or New York were pretty well loaded, as I have often
been with letters to be delivered not only to friends, but also to
men in business.</p>

<p>If cheap postage is a blessing, it may be doubted whether it
is an unalloyed one. As one of its penalties, letter writing
has become a lost art. A three-line note or a postal card, or
what is worse, a dictation by a stenographer from which the
last vestige of communion of friend with friend is completely
extinguished, has taken the place of the welcome epistles
which our grandmothers and aunts wrote with care, and filled
full not only with gossip and family news, but also with instructive
comments on events of the day. How much future
readers will lose by the absence of such volumes of correspondence
as have graced our literature during the last hundred
years!</p>

<p>In connection with letters it may be well enough to say for
the benefit of my young readers that until 1840 envelopes were
unknown, and letters were universally folded and sealed either
with sealing wax or wafers.</p>

<p>There was an expression of deliberation and composure investing
such correspondence which is lost in the correspondence
of today. Now and then some impecunious person
found sealing wax and even wafers unnecessarily extravagant.
I was told many years ago by a man who called on the late
Joshua Sears who left his millions to a son, recently deceased,
that he found him splitting wafers. Since the days of envelopes
I have known an officer of one of our institutions to save
all his letters, and turn the envelopes for future use.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>


<p>William Watson, the first postmaster of Plymouth, was
the son of John and Priscilla (Thomas) Watson, and
was born in Plymouth, May 6, 1730, and graduated
at Harvard in 1751. In addition to the office of postmaster,
he was appointed in 1782 naval officer for the port of
Plymouth, and in 1789 he was commissioned collector by
Washington. In 1803 he was removed by Jefferson from
both the office of postmaster and collector, and died April 22,
1815. In 1765 he bought the lot of land in Court street, on
which the Old Colony Club house stands, and there can be no
doubt that he built the house now standing, and occupied it
until his death. After the death of Mr. Watson, the estate
was bought by my grandfather, William Davis, and occupied
by my uncle, Nathaniel Morton Davis from the time of his
marriage in 1817 until his death, when its occupancy passed
to his son, Col. Wm. Davis.</p>

<p>The story of the life of the mother of Wm. Watson is full
of romantic interest. She was Priscilla Thomas, a daughter
of Caleb and Priscilla (Capen) Thomas of Marshfield. She
became engaged to Noah Hobart, a divinity student, who was
at the time teaching school in Duxbury. John Watson of
Plymouth, who had married in 1715, Sarah, daughter of Daniel
Rogers of Ipswich, lost his wife, and not knowing of the
engagement of Miss Thomas, made through her father, an offer
of marriage. As Mr. Watson was a man of high standing
and abundant means, Mr. Thomas was favorably impressed
by the offer, and said that he would consult his wife
and daughter. A family council was held, into which Mr.
Hobart was called, and it was finally decided with the assent
of Mr. Hobart, who was ready to make any sacrifice to secure
a happy establishment for life for one whom he sincerely loved,
to accept Mr. Watson’s offer. Thus with a tearful parting
two loving hearts were separated apparently forever. In
1729 John Watson and Priscilla Thomas were married, and
the first act of a new romance of John and Priscilla was performed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
In 1732 Mr. Watson died, and at that time his son,
Elkanah, was a nursing infant. At about the same time
the wife of Isaac Lothrop died, leaving also a nursing infant.
As the families were intimate, Mrs. Watson offered to nurse
Mrs. Lothrop’s infant with her own. The natural consequence
of the family relations was an offer of marriage from
Mr. Lothrop, which was unhesitatingly accepted. The alliance
was an eligible one. Mr. Lothrop was one of the Justices
of the Court, and was possessed of a large estate. The
marriage took place in 1733, and he died April 26, 1750, having
by a life illustrating the highest qualities of the human
character deserved the following inscription on his gravestone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Had virtue’s charms the power to save</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Its faithful votaries from the grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">This stone had ne’er possessed the fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of being marked with Lothrop’s name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime it may be interesting to learn what had
become of Noah Hobart, the old time lover. He in due time
entered the ministry, and was settled over the church in Fairfield,
Conn. Though he had never held communication with
Priscilla by letter or otherwise, by the wireless ways which
lovers have, he had kept himself informed of the varied
scenes in her life. He knew of the death of her first husband,
and her second marriage, as well as the two families of children
which had grown up around her. He had heard also of
the death of her second husband, while with a wife and two
children of his own, a veil not wholly impenetrable obscured
the remembrance of his early days. About seven years after
the death of Mr. Lothrop her second husband, the wife of
Mr. Hobart died, and after a becoming period of mourning,
his old love, which time had not obliterated, speedily revived
at the thought that both he and his early love were free.
Without delay he, as was the fashion of the time, drove in
his chaise to Plymouth, and presented himself as suitor at
the Lothrop mansion. It is unnecessary to disclose the interview.
A further sacrifice was needed before in the fullness
of time God should join together whom man had put asunder.
She had promised her husband on his death bed that as long
as his mother lived, then eighty years of age, she would like
a real daughter care for her and promote her happiness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Again there was a parting which seemed to be one forever.
On his way home Mr. Hobart stopped over night with his
friend, Rev. Mr. Shute of Hingham, and attended with him
the next day a religious service in the church held every
Thursday, which was sometimes called the Thursday lecture,
and sometimes the Preparatory lecture. On their way home
from church a friend passed them on horseback, who said that
he had ridden from Plymouth. In answer to the inquiry for
news in the old town he said that just as he left he was told
that old Mrs. Lothrop was found dead in her bed that morning.
It is needless to say that the continuance of the journey
to Fairfield was postponed, and a return to Plymouth was
made. After the funeral and a due publication of the bans,
the marriage took place under date of 1758, and the seventeen
years which she passed in Fairfield with her third husband,
were the happiest years of her life. Mr. Hobart died
in 1775, and she returned to Plymouth, where the remainder
of her days was spent until her death, June 23, 1796, in the
90th year of her age.</p>

<p>John Sloss Hobart, son of Rev. Noah Hobart, by his first
wife, became United States Senator from New York, and his
daughter, Ellen, married Nathaniel Lothrop, a son of Mrs.
Hobart by her second husband, Isaac Lothrop.</p>

<p>Returning to the old house where Davis building stands,
of which in my wanderings I have almost lost sight, its later
occupants whom I can remember were Capt. Woodward, the
driver for many years of the Boston mail stage, his son-in-law
Bradford Barnes, John R. Davis and George Churchill.
All of these except Mr. Davis have been noticed in other
chapters. Mr. Davis was a ropemaker by trade, but when the
Robbins Cordage Company discontinued work he sought
other means of livelihood, chiefly that of restaurant keeper.
He was a good man, of a deeply religious spirit, who carried
his religion into every day life. He not only believed in the
fatherhood of God, but also in the brotherhood of man. It
would have been impossible to provoke him to the utterance
of an angry or unkind word, and his kindly words often appeared
more kind with the touch of humor in which they
were uttered. His kindness of heart and gentleness of speech,
and his humor as well, were illustrated when a man after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
eating at his lunch counter left without paying. Instead of
running out to the sidewalk and calling out to the man in the
hearing of passers-by “to come back and pay his bill,” he
said in the mildest tone of voice, “Mr., did I give you the
right change?”</p>

<p>The house now occupied as a public house, and called the
Plymouth Tavern, was for many years identified with the
family of Joshua Thomas. He bought the house in 1786, and
occupied it until his death, January 10, 1821. He married in
1786 Isabella Stevenson, of Boston, who continued to occupy
it until her death. Few families displayed more earnest patriotism
than the family to which he belonged. His father,
Dr. William Thomas, born in Boston in 1718, practised medicine
in Plymouth many years, and died September 20, 1802.
He was on the medical staff in the expedition against Louisburg
in 1745, and at Crown Point in 1758. He had four sons
born in Plymouth, Joshua, Joseph, Nathaniel and John.
Joshua was born in 1751, and graduated at Harvard in 1772.
After some time spent in teaching, and in theological studies,
he became especially interested in public affairs, and in 1774
was adjutant of a regiment of militia organized in Plymouth
County, in view of the threatening war clouds appearing
above the horizon. In 1776 he served on the staff of General
John Thomas on the Canadian expedition, in which General
Thomas died, and soon after returned home where he studied
law, and henceforth devoted himself to his profession. Having
served as a member of the committee of correspondence
and as Representative and Senator, he was appointed in 1792
Judge of Probate, and continued in office until his death. He
was also President of the Plymouth and Norfolk counties
Bible Society, the first president of the Pilgrim Society,
and Moderator of town meetings twenty-eight years.
He lay on his bed of death during the celebration of December
22, 1820, when Daniel Webster delivered the oration, and
John Watson was selected to preside on that occasion. Judge
Thomas had three sons, John Boies, 1787, William, 1788, and
Joshua Barker, 1797. John Boies graduated at Harvard in
1806, and married Mary, daughter of Isaac LeBaron. He
was a member of the bar, a member of the Board of Selectmen,
from 1831 to 1840, inclusive, moderator of town meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
from 1829 to 1841, inclusive, President of the Old Colony
Bank and Clerk of the Plymouth County Courts from
1811 to his death, December 2, 1852. William Thomas, the
second son of Joshua, graduated at Harvard in 1807, and was
at the time of his death, September 20, 1882, the oldest living
graduate. He practiced law in Plymouth, was in 1852 sheriff
of the county, and married in 1816 Sally W., daughter of
John Sever of Kingston. Joshua Barker, the youngest son of
Joshua, was also a member of the bar, but never practised.
Though not fitted by temperament for the labors of his profession,
he was a man of culture, and a conversationalist,
whom it was always agreeable to meet. Much younger than
his brothers, he was always an indulged and petted son. I
heard when I was young of an amusing effort to send him
to a boarding school. His father and mother, with great reluctance,
and only from a sense of duty, decided to send him
to a school known as the Wing school in Sandwich. So they
started one morning with their boy in a chaise, and a trunk
strapped to the axle. After leaving him in the hands of Mr.
Wing they regretfully bade him good-bye and left for home.
They drove into their yard, landing at the rear door, and
going into the house, found Joshua sitting by the fire, having
ridden home on the axle and entered the house at the front
door before them. They were overjoyed to see him, and
embraced him with as much fervor as if he had returned
from a long term at school. He died in Plymouth unmarried,
March 7, 1873.</p>

<p>After the death of the widow of Judge Thomas, the house
was occupied for some years by Allen and S. D. Ballard as
an eating saloon, with lodging rooms to let. The Ballards
were succeeded by Mr. Holbrook, and under the name of the
Central House it was occupied by Charles H. Snell. Mr.
Huntoon and Mr. McIntire and St. George and Manley E.
Dodge followed, who were succeeded by Mr. Shaw, Mr.
Minchen, and Bruce and Abbot Jones followed, and then
Jones alone, who was succeeded by McCarthy and Buckman,
and the recent proprietor, Mr. McCarthy. The name was
changed to Plymouth Tavern by Mr. Bruce. Joseph Thomas,
a brother of Judge Joshua Thomas, born in 1755, was in the
early part of the revolution a Lieutenant of Artillery, and later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Captain and Major. He died in Plymouth unmarried, Aug.
19, 1838. Nathaniel, another brother, born in 1756, was a Captain
in the revolution, and died in Plymouth, March 22, 1838.
He married in 1781 Priscilla Shaw, and second in 1796, Jane
(Downs) widow of Isaac Jackson. John, a third brother of
Judge Joshua Thomas, born in 1758, was on the medical
staff during the revolution, and after the war settled in
Poughkeepsie. Some of his descendants are living in Cleveland,
Ohio.</p>

<p>As long ago as I can remember the house next to the store
of Moore Bros., on the north was occupied by Benjamin
Marston Watson, and was built by him on a vacant lot in
1811. He was a son of John and Lucia (Marston) Watson,
born in 1774, and married in 1804 Lucretia Burr, daughter of
Jonathan Sturges of Fairfield, Conn. His only children remembered
by me were Lucretia Ann, who married Rev.
Hersey B. Goodwin, and was the mother of Professor William
Watson Goodwin of Cambridge; and Benjamin Marston.
His son, Benjamin Marston Watson, born January 17, 1820,
graduated at Harvard in 1839, and married in 1846, Mary,
daughter of Thomas Russell, and died February 19, 1896.
He was a lovable man, whose companionship I prized; a man
of culture, who enjoyed the friendship of Emerson and Alcott
and Thoreau; a man in whose presence ordinary ambitions
appeared insignificant and mean; a lover of nature with
its fruits and flowers, who received in return from nature’s
hand congenial occupation and support.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson, senior, was a merchant in Plymouth, President
of the Plymouth Aqueduct Company, one of the founders
of the Pilgrim Society, and for many years its recording
secretary. He was also chosen treasurer of the Plymouth
institution for savings at the time of its organization in 1828,
but declined a re-election in 1829. As a boy I remember him
well looking over into the trench of the aqueduct and cleaning
perch at a South Pond picnic and putting wood on the
parlor fire, in doing which he had a way inherited by his son
of standing with his limbs straight from feet to hips, and his
body at a sharp angle straight from hips to head without a
lounge or a bend. He died while on a visit to Fairfield, November
10, 1835. In 1845 his widow sold the house to William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Thomas, who has been already noticed, and it is now
owned and occupied by his grandchildren, children of William
H. Whitman, who married his daughter Ann.</p>

<p>Captain William Bartlett, whose widow occupies the next
house, has been already noticed in connection with the loss
of the bark, Charles Bartlett, of which he was master. The
house has, however, other interesting associations. In the
middle of the eighteenth century it was owned and occupied
by Ansel Lothrop. Mary Lothrop, daughter of Ansel, had a
son born in the house, who received the name of his father,
Elkanah Cushman, and was brought up and educated by him.
The son was at one time engaged in business as a member of
the Boston firm of Cushman &amp; Topliffe, and lived in various
places in Charlestown, and in the north end of Boston.
Among his places of residence was a wooden house on Richmond
street, now called Parmenter street, between Hanover
and Salem streets, and there Charlotte Cushman, his daughter,
was born, July 23, 1816. It is a little singular that John Gibbs
Gilbert, the distinguished actor, should have been born six
years before in an adjacent house. Mr. Cushman attended
with his family the Second Church on Hanover street, between
Richmond and North Bennet streets, of which Henry
Ware, Jr., Ralph Waldo Emerson and Chandler Robbins
were pastors before new places of worship were found in Bedford
street, and finally in Copley Square. The site of the
Cushman house is now occupied by a school house erected in
1866, and named after the distinguished actress, the “Cushman
School.” Miss Cushman early displayed creditable vocal
talent, and was one of the choir in the Second Church. On
Thursday evening, March 25, 1830, she appeared at a concert
given at No. 1 Franklin avenue, by Mr. G. Farmer, her music
teacher, when she sung, “Take this Rose,” “Oh, merry row
the bonny bark just parting from the shore,” and “Farewell,
my love.” Until 1835 she continued to sing in church, and
in April of that year, while J. G. Maeder and his wife, who
was Clara Fisher, were producing English opera at the Tremont
Theatre, the contralto fell ill, and Miss Cushman was
selected to sing the Countess Almaviva in Mozart’s “Marriage
of Figaro” in her place. The next part she sang under
the Maeders was Lucy Bertram in “Guy Mannering,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
thus she was early brought into association with the dramatization,
in which she became famous. Being shortly afterwards
engaged to sing in English operas in New Orleans,
she made a sea voyage to that city, during which, as I have
always heard, she lost her voice in consequence of the change
of climate. Rev. J. Henry Wiggin, whose family were acquainted
with the Cushmans at the Northend, and to whom
I am indebted for many of the facts in this notice, attributes
the loss of voice to the overstraining to which she subjected
it after her arrival in New Orleans. Further effort as a singer
was of course hopeless, and returning to New York she
served three years as a stock actor in the old Park Theatre,
under Manager Simpson. It is unnecessary to follow her distinguished
career further than to speak of one passage in it,
which came under my direct notice. During the winter of
1843 and 1844, which I spent in Philadelphia, she was the
lessee and manager of the Chestnut Street Theatre, where I
saw her repeatedly in Macbeth, Julia in the Hunchback, Juliana
in the Honeymoon, Queen Katherine, Meg Merrilies,
Oberon, Bianca in Milman’s Fazio; Lady Gay Sparker, Shylock
and Beatrice. In 1847 I saw her at the Haymarket
Theatre in London, and I remember how my patriotism was
stirred by the rapturous applause her acting elicited. During
the Philadelphia winter, to which I have alluded, Miss Cushman,
with her father and a brother, whom she was educating
at the Pennsylvania Medical School, was a regular attendant
morning and evening, at the Unitarian Church, of which Rev.
Dr. Furness was pastor.</p>

<p>Miss Cushman had a younger sister, Susan, whose beauty
presented a marked contrast to her own masculine plainness.
In early life Susan married at the Northend a tailor by the
name of Merriman, after whose death Charlotte introduced
her to the stage, and as Romeo to Susan’s Juliet, played
Romeo and Juliet in London one hundred nights. On the
9th of March, 1848, Susan married in Liverpool Dr. James
S. Muspratt, Professor of Chemistry, in that city, and died
there May 10, 1859. Charlotte Cushman died in Boston, February
18, 1876, and was buried from King’s Chapel on Washington’s
birthday.</p>

<p>Until 1858 a dwelling house stood on the south corner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Court square, which in that year was removed for the purpose
of widening the square. All through my youth that
house was owned and occupied by Captain Joseph Bartlett.
He bought the house in 1800, of Nathaniel Thomas, having
up to that time, after his marriage, lived in Wellingsley on an
estate which had previously belonged to his father-in-law,
Joseph Churchill. Captain Bartlett, through life, kept up the
Churchill farm, the entrance to which was through a gate at
Jabez Corner. Warren avenue, when it was laid out, followed
the cartway, which led through his farm. More than once
Captain Bartlett took me in his chaise over to his farm at
Poverty Point, as it was called, and I have a vivid recollection
of the apples with which I filled my pockets, and the
sweet corn which the old gentleman gave me to carry home
to my mother. His chaise was one with an iron axle, and
its loud rattle in his comings and goings always indicated
his latitude and longitude. For many years he was an enterprising
and successful ship owner and merchant, and in 1803
bought the lot on the north corner of Court square, and built
and occupied the brick house now occupied by William Hedge.
His losses were so severe during the embargoes and the war
of 1812, that in 1820 he moved back to his old home, and continued
to occupy it until his death. He was a son of Samuel
and Betsey (Moore) Bartlett, and was born June 16, 1762,
and married in 1784, Rebecca Churchill, and had William,
1786, Rebecca, Susan, 1795, Joseph, Augustus, John, Samuel,
Benjamin and Eliza Ann. He married second in 1821, Lucy,
daughter of Charles Dyer, and died March 4, 1835. His
son, William Bartlett, married in 1814, Susan, daughter of
Dr. James Thatcher, and had Susan Louisa, 1815, who married
Charles O. Boutelle, Elizabeth Thatcher, 1818, John,
1820, and Eliza Ann, 1825.</p>

<p>John Bartlett, son of William and Susan (Thatcher) Bartlett,
became distinguished in both commercial and literary
life, and deserves a special notice. He was born in Plymouth,
June 14, 1820. When his grandfather, Joseph Bartlett,
removed in 1820 to his old home, his son, William, the father
of John, who had been occupying his father’s house since his
marriage in 1814, moved into the brick house and kept it as
a public house under the name of the Old Colony Hotel. Exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
how long William Bartlett kept the house I have no
means of knowing, but he was succeeded in a year or two,
by William Spooner, who was in turn succeeded by Ezra
Cushing until 1827, when the house was bought by Nathaniel
Russell, and became his residence. I have a letter from Judge
John Davis of Boston, dated September 23, 1820, to my
grandfather, William Davis, disclosing a plan, proposed by
William Sturgis and others, friends of the Pilgrim Society,
in Boston, to purchase the house for a memorial edifice, dedicated
to the Pilgrims. The plan was to have it kept as a
hotel, where meetings of the society might be held, and dinners
and balls provided for on anniversary days. Judge
Davis was opposed to the scheme, and finally a committee of
Boston gentlemen was appointed to aid the trustees of the
society in erecting such a memorial as might be agreeable to
them. The gentlemen appointed as the committee were Lemuel
Shaw, Francis C. Gray, Harrison Gray Otis, Isaac P.
Davis, James Savage, George Bond, Benjamin Rich, Francis
Bassett, John T. Winthrop and Nathan Hale.</p>

<p>Returning now to John Bartlett, who was born June 14,
1820, the year in which at an unknown date his father moved
into the brick house, it is impossible to determine in which
house he was born. He was educated in the public schools
of Plymouth, and was my schoolmate and playmate. In the
autumn of 1836 he entered the bookbinding establishment
connected with the University Bookstore in Cambridge, of
which John Owen was the proprietor. In the next year, 1837,
he became a clerk in the bookstore, and at once displayed remarkable
aptitude for the business. He was an extensive
reader, and possessed a wide knowledge of authors, and was
soon recognized as an expert in the preparation of books for
the press. In August, 1846, Mr. Owen failed, and he continued
as clerk with his successor, George Nichols, until 1849,
when he bought out Mr. Nichols. In 1859 he sold out his
store to Sever &amp; Francis, having published a number of
books for various authors. He had also published three editions
of his “Familiar Quotations,” the first of which was issued
in 1856. In 1861 he prepared a few books for publication,
but transferred them to Sever &amp; Francis. In 1862 he
served as volunteer paymaster nine months on board Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Du Pont’s despatch boat. In August, 1863, he entered the
publishing house of Little, Brown &amp; Co., as clerk, with the
promise that at the expiration of eighteen months, when the
existing partnership would terminate, he would be taken into
the firm. In 1864 Little, Brown &amp; Co. published the fourth
edition of his “Familiar Quotations,” and an edition de luxe
of “Walton’s Angler,” edited by him. In February, 1865,
he became a partner in the firm, and the literary, manufacturing
and advertising departments were assigned to him,
all of which he retained during his connection with the firm.
In 1882 Little, Brown &amp; Co. published his Shakespeare
“Phrase Book,” and in February, 1889, having been several
years senior partner, he retired from the firm in order to
complete his “Shakespeare Concordance.” The fifth and sixth
editions of “Quotations” were published by Little, Brown &amp;
Co., the seventh and eighth by Routledge of London, and
the ninth by Little, Brown &amp; Co., and Macmillan &amp; Co. of
London, and of all these editions, more than two hundred
thousand copies, have been sold.</p>

<p>In 1891 Macmillan &amp; Co., of London, offered to publish his
“Shakespeare Concordance” at their own risk, and it was issued
by them in 1894. In recognition of his literary service,
he was made in 1892 a member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences; in 1871 was awarded by Harvard an honorary
degree of Master of Arts, and in 1894, he was made an
honorary member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He married,
June 4, 1851, Hannah, daughter of Sydney Willard,
Professor of Hebrew at Harvard from 1805 to 1831, and
granddaughter of Joseph Willard, President of Harvard
from 1781 to 1804, and died in Cambridge, December 3,
1905.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the occupants of the brick house on the
north corner of Court Square, before 1827, when it came into
the possession of Nathaniel Russell, who occupied it from
that time until his death, October 21, 1852. He was the son
of John and Mercy (Foster) Russell, and was born April 6,
1769, in the house on the west side of Main street next north
of Mr. Gooding’s watchmaker’s store, where his father lived
from 1759 to 1776. After reaching manhood he was engaged
for a time in business in Bridgewater, removing to Plymouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
not long after the year 1800, and occupying the house which
until recently stood on the lower corner of Middle street and
LeBaron’s alley. About 1808 he removed to the house on the
north side of Summer street next to the house on the
corner of Ring Lane, and made that his home until he bought
the house on the corner of Court Square. He was extensively
engaged many years in iron manufactures in connection
with William Davis and Barnabas Hedge, and after 1837, as
the head of the firm of N. Russell &amp; Co. He was a man who
always had at heart the welfare of his native town, and joined
in every movement to elevate its social and moral condition.
A Lyceum in 1829, of which he was President; a Temperance
Society at about the same date, with which he was connected;
a Peace Society in 1831, and affairs of the church, of which
he was a member, always commanded his aid and support.
He married, June 18, 1800, Martha, daughter of Isaac LeBaron,
and had Nathaniel, Mary Howland, Andrew Leach,
Mercy Ann, Francis James, LeBaron and Lucia Jane. He
was always known in my day as Captain Nathaniel Russell,
having been commissioned by Governor Samuel Adams, May
25, 1795, Captain in the Fourth Regiment, first brigade and
fifth division of the State Militia. Nathaniel Russell, Jr.,
born in Bridgewater, December 18, 1801, graduated at Harvard
in 1820, and became associated with his father in business.
He married, June 25, 1827, Catherine Elizabeth,
daughter of Daniel Robert and Betsey Hayward (Thacher)
Elliott of Savannah, Georgia, and died February 16, 1875.
He will be further mentioned later.</p>

<p>Mary Howland Russell, born October 22, 1803, died January
12, 1862.</p>

<p>Andrew L. Russell, born May 16, 1806, graduated at Harvard
in 1827, and was engaged at one time in the dry goods’
jobbing business in Central street, Boston, in partnership with
William S. Russell, and later with N. Russell &amp; Co. in Plymouth.
He married, May 3, 1832, Laura Dewey, and, second,
October 5, 1841, Hannah White, daughter of William Davis,
Jr. He has been already noticed in connection with the rows
of elms planted by him on Court street, which if not consigned
to death by the concrete sidewalks, will serve as a lasting
memorial of his service to his native town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Mercy Ann, born August 16, 1809, died September 18,
1832.</p>

<p>Francis James graduated at Harvard in 1831, and died
September 6, 1833.</p>

<p>LeBaron graduated at Harvard in 1832, and died August
19, 1889.</p>

<p>Lucia Jane, born November 22, 1821, married Rev. Dr.
George W. Briggs, November 5, 1849, and died November
1, 1881.</p>

<p>LeBaron Russell, above mentioned, studied medicine in
Boston and Paris, and established himself in Boston. Indisposed
to active labor in his profession, he devoted himself to
literary pursuits, and by his interest in the schools and charities
of the city, led a useful and beneficent life.</p>

<p>The house itself, so long identified with the Russell family,
deserves special notice. It is a fine example of the style of
domestic architecture which had its origin in the middle of
the eighteenth century. It has been suggested by some that
it was designed by Charles Bulfinch, but I lived from 1849 to
1853 in a block of houses on Franklin street in Boston, designed
by him, and I remember nothing in their exterior or
interior to suggest his handiwork. I am inclined to think
that it was modelled after the designs of Peter Harrison,
an English architect, examples of whose work may be found
in Salem, which were followed more or less closely in later
times in that city, and in Marblehead and Portsmouth. Harrison
came to Newport, R. I., in 1829, in the ship with Bishop
Berkley and Smibert, the distinguished portrait painter, and
before his death, which occurred in Boston, designed the Redwood
library in Newport, King’s chapel in Boston, and
Christ’s church in Cambridge. Symmetry and proportion
were the characteristics of his work, and no better illustration
of these exquisite qualities can be found than in his original
efforts and their faithful copies. The beautiful old porch of
the house in question, rounded in shape and supported by
clover leaf columns, harmonizing with the windows beneath
and above it, was replaced by the present one about 1840.</p>

</div>


<p>To break the monotony of personal reminiscence, I shall
recall some of the games which prevailed in my
youth. When the April showers and the dog days come
year after year at their appointed times, we are satisfied with
the explanation that they are following the order of nature.
When in their seasons the robins build their nests, and the
blackbirds gather in flocks preparatory to their autumn flight,
we are content with the statement that they are guided by instinct.
But we have no answer to the question—why we boys,
as if in obedience to a mysterious edict issued by a secret
council, each year simultaneously in all our towns brought
from their winter quarters our alleys and taws, and snapped
our marbles on every available sidewalk. After the marble
fever had run, like measles, a certain number of days, the
scene suddenly changed, and driving hoop was the order of
the day. The hoop was not one of those toy hoops we see in
these days, galvanized iron rings, with an attachment to push
them with, but the genuine hoop from an oil cask, one from
the bilge for the larger boys, and one from the chine for the
smaller ones. When we gathered at twilight, and either in
single or double file, made the circuit of the town, we made
the welkin ring literally to beat the band.</p>

<p>After the hoop came, as now, the ball games, skip, one old
cat, two old cat, hit or miss, and round ball. We made our
own balls, winding yarn over a core of India rubber, until the
right size was reached, and then working a loop stitch all
around it with good, hard, tightly spun twine. Attempts were
occasionally made to play ball in the streets, but the by-laws
of the town forbidding it were rigidly enforced. There were
four gangs of boys, the North street gang, which played in
the Jackson field in the rear of North street; the Court street
gang, which played in Captain Joseph Bartlett’s field, where
the easterly end of Russell street and the adjoining buildings
are; the Summer street gang, which played in Cow Hill Valley,
and the “tother side gang,” which played on Training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
Green, sometimes to the detriment of neighboring windows.</p>

<p>While the days were longest the street games were next in
order, hare and hounds, prison bar, leap frog, Tom Tiddler’s
ground, Red Lion in his den, I spy, hide and seek, nine holes,
back side in the way, and follow the leader.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Over hill and dale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through bush, through briar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over park and dale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through flood, through fire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wherever the leader went we must follow, over fences,
off stone walls, in and out of houses, astonishing families,
and if the boot of the head of the family was in order, coming
out a little more expeditiously than we went in. The
members of the North street gang, to which I belonged, were
besides myself and brother, Augustus H. Tribble, the Collingwood
boys, John J. Russell, Richard W. Bagnall, Lewis
Weston, the Jackson boys, Thomas Cotton, Charles Cotton,
George Maynard, George Gooding and Charles T. May.</p>

<p>Football came next in the early autumn, with a ball made
of an ox bladder inserted in a leather case of our own making.
We bought the bladder at the slaughter house, and put it in
pickle until it was ready to be used, and then when the case
was made we put it through a slit, and blowing it up with a
quill tied a string around the nozzle, laced up the slit, and the
game began. In those days all the boys wore boots, and consequently
little damage was done to our shins.</p>

<p>With the coming of the first cool nights we hunted in the
morning for strips of ice in the gutter, and spent the hour
before school in sliding, boys and girls together, the girls, I
never knew the reason why, giving a little hop at the beginning
of their slide. And then came our sliding down hill,
the larger boys with George P. Hayward and William Rider
Drew and Jesse Turner at their head. Mr. Hayward’s Constitution,
painted green, and having round steel spring runners,
taking the lead, would slide from the top of Burial Hill
down through a wide open gate between the high schoolhouse
and the Unitarian church, along Leyden street, down
Turner’s hill to the end of Barnes’ wharf. The smaller boys
would spend the afternoons of Saturday perfectly happy on
the short slide from the bottom of the Middle street steps to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Water street. All our sleds were made to order, scorning as
we would if they had been purchasable, the toy sleds which
can now be bought for a song, and are high at the price.
There was a sled of domestic manufacture in my day which,
considering its cheapness and simplicity, was a quite satisfactory
sled in the minds of those who could afford no better.
It was made of six white oak cask staves, three above and
three below, with the convex on the outside, and a cleat at
each end between the staves, to which it was nailed. With
a little less speed, perhaps, than other sleds, yet in humpy
dagger and belly hacker in wearing out boot toes, and heels,
they were as efficient as any. With skating and its accompaniment
hockey, the winter passed away, and the year came
to an end. Of course many out of door games now in vogue
were not known in my early days. Cricket was little played,
while croquet, tennis, and golf had not made their appearance.
To these modern innovations doubtless before long
curling and lacrosse will be added. The game of ten pins
was a familiar one, but its enjoyment was limited by the
almost entire absence of alleys until the Samoset alleys were
built in 1845. There was a poor, short alley on Billington
Sea Island, but rarely used except on the occasion of picnics.
It was by no means an uncommon thing in the college vacation
to go as far as Holmes’ Tavern, near Harrub’s corner,
and roll in the alleys of Mr. Holmes, whose lame back we
sorely tried by his efforts to act as ball boy, and sometimes
we went as far as an alley near the Cushman cotton factory,
beyond Plympton Green. Carriage hire in those days was
so low that such an afternoon expedition could be had without
extravagance. We could hire for a half a day at George
Drew’s stable in Middle street, for a dollar, either Dolly or
Little Jack, or the Eastern mare, or the Peabody horse with a
chaise, or for a dollar and a half, Bob sorrel with a carryall.
I say chaise, a name derived through the English word chair,
from the French chaire, because buggies were unknown in
Plymouth in my youth. Buggies were introduced from India,
where in Hindustani they were called baggi or bagghi, four
wheeled carriages with hoods, and our wagon is derived from
the Dutch word wagen. Every family owning a horse had a
chaise, and carriage houses were universally called chaise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
houses, as they are still by myself, and older persons. The
fronts of these houses were always made with curved tops,
and I know of only three now left in town, those of Mrs.
Lothrop, Father Buckley and William Rider Drew. The
first buggy in Plymouth was brought from Boston by my
uncle, Nathaniel Morton Davis in the 1830’s, and was owned
by John Harlow of Chiltonville at the time of his death a few
years ago.</p>

<p>Of the indoor games of my youth, battledore and shuttlecock
and the graces have gone out. The other games of the
young were as they are now, blind man’s buff, scandal, cribbage,
backgammon, commerce, whist, chess, checkers, vingt-un,
all fours, bragg, loo and euchre. The gambling game of
bridge was unknown, as it ought to be today. Quadrille was
played by older people, and Boston, after a disappearance
for many years, was again introduced in 1844. Piquet, the
ancient game of ombre adapted to four instead of three persons,
and played also by older persons, was immortalized by
Pope in the following lines:</p>

<p>In the selection of leaders and sides in the out of door
games, what were called “countings out” were used, very
curious doggerels, whose origin is as mysterious as that of language
itself. They are used in every town in every state in
our Union, and have been found in more than twenty languages,
including English, French, Spanish, German, Russian,
Dutch, Gallic, Turkish, Hindustani, Japanese, Hawaiian,
Irish, Romani, Cornish, etc. There is a vein of similarity
running through them, though changes and additions and corruptions
have been the result of their adoption into various
dialects. In closing this chapter I subjoin the following list
of such as my own memory, and that of others have furnished
me, and such as I have found in print.</p>

<p>The last two were used in Plymouth in the ball game of
skip. One of the two boys who chose sides tossed the
bat to the other who caught it and held it. Then the two
alternately grasped it hand over hand, and if there was
enough of the bat left for the next one to hold it, and throw
it over his head, he had the first choice of players.</p>

<p>I will add in this chapter some additional memoranda relating
to marine matters, before proceeding with the regular order
which I had prescribed for my memories. In connection
with the account of vessels built and owned in Plymouth, it
will not be inappropriate to speak of those in Kingston and
Duxbury, of which I have any recollection, or of which I have
been able to obtain an account. All of these in entering or
leaving their port passed through the waters of Plymouth.</p>

<p>Ezra Weston &amp; Sons owned more vessels than any other
firm in New England, except William Gray of Salem, and,
perhaps, more than any other in the United States, with the
above exception. The following is a partial list of their vessels
built in Duxbury with their tonnage as far as ascertained,
for which I am indebted to Major Joshua M. Cushing of Duxbury.</p>

<p>Ezra Weston, son of Ezra and Salumith (Wadsworth) Weston
of Duxbury, was born November 30, 1771. He married
Jerusha Bradford, and died August 15, 1842. His sons, living

<p>Mr. Holmes was in many respects a remarkable man. He
was born in Kingston in 1771, and died in that town in 1862.
On the 27th of May, 1821, he went to Bridgewater and collected
materials for building a vessel, hiring a yard near the
Raynham line and laid the keel of the brig Two Pollies. After
launching the brig Trident in 1806, she took all the spare
materials in the yard, and carried them to Kingston, where all
his vessels were built except the Two Pollies, Algol, Lucy,
Alexander and Trident, which were built in Bridgewater. He
stated in a letter written July 1, 1859, that he kept a vessel on
the stocks nearly all the time, and sometimes two, and once
built three in a year, all of which he built, fitted and sent to sea,
except two, on his own account and risk. In that letter he
said that at the age of 87 years and 7 months, he was about
to lay the keel of a vessel of two hundred tons, and that he
was writing the letter without spectacles. I knew him well,
and often called at his house on the corner of Main street.
He did his bank business in Boston, leaving only at the Plymouth
Bank a deposit made up chiefly of his bank dividends, and
I was a little amused by a incident which occurred somewhere
between 1859 and 1862, for which I never saw an explanation,
though I think it may have been intended as a personal compliment.
One day while in the bank he said, “I don’t suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
you would lend me any money if I wanted it.” Knowing very
well that he was never in want of money, I said, “Mr. Holmes,
make out your note payable to your own order for such an
amount and on such a time as may be agreeable to you, and
endorse it, and you can have the money.” He signed a note
for $5,000 on four months, and told me to place the money to
his credit. I did so, and the money remained untouched until
the note became due.</p>

<p>The following vessels were built and owned by his son Edward
Holmes of Kingston:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent fs80">

<p>Besides the above, the ship Matchless was built in Boston,
and owned by James H. Dawes of Kingston, and the ship
Brookline, with others, was owned by John and James N.
Sever of Kingston.</p>

<p>The following is a list of Kingston captains in the merchant
service within my memory, for which I am indebted to Capt.
John C. Dawes of Kingston:</p>

<p>William Adams, Frederick C. Bailey, Justus Bailey, Otis
Baker, George Bicknell, Calvin Bryant, Cephas Dawes, James
H. Dawes, John C. Dawes, Paraclete Holmes, Edward Richardson,
Benjamin T. Robbins, James W. Sever, Charles Stetson,
William Symmes, Peter Winsor, William Winsor.</p>

<p>The following is a partial list of vessels wrecked within my
memory in Plymouth waters:</p>

<p>The earliest wreck in Plymouth waters of which I have any
recollection, was that of the brig Sally Ann, Captain Caulfield,
in January, 1835, bound from Porto Rico to Boston.
She was owned by Charles W. Shepard of Salem, and after
striking on Brown’s Island became a total wreck on the beach.
No lives were lost, and Martin Gould, one of the crew, became
a permanent resident of Plymouth, and married in 1836
Ruth (Westgate) widow of William Barrett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>The next wreck within my memory was that of the brig
Regulator of Boston, Phelps master, on Brown’s Island,
February 4, 1836. She was bound from Smyrna to Boston,
and with rudder and rigging frozen, and the vessel unmanageable,
she came into the bay in a gale from east, northeast,
and bore away for Plymouth to find an anchorage in Saquish
Cove, where she saw a brig lying. She dropped her anchor
at the entrance of the channel in three fathoms of water, and
in the heavy swell struck hard. At eight in the evening she
floated with the tide, and held on until seven o’clock the next
morning, when she drifted into the breakers, and the captain
cut away his foremast, which carried with it the main mast,
and the main yard. At half-past eight she began to break up,
and George Dryden, an Englishman, Daniel Canton of New
York, and Augustus Tilton of Vermont, who took to the long
boat, capsized fifty yards under the lea of the brig and were
lost. John Smith, a Swede, and a Greek boy, were killed by
the wreckage, and the remainder of the crew retreated to the
main rigging, and their final safety was due to the presence,
in the channel, under the Gurnet, of the brig Cervantes of
Salem, Kendrick, master, which bound into Boston from
Charleston, had succeeded in finding a safe anchorage. The
crew of the Cervantes, after six hours of heroic work, took
off the men and carried them to their own vessel. The cargo
of the Regulator consisted of four hundred and sixty bales of
wool, twenty-five cases of opium, twenty-five cases of gum
Arabic, twelve bales of senna, two thousand drums of Sultana
raisins, five packages of cow’s tails, one case of saffron flower,
four hundred sacks of salt, and five tons of logwood. The
men saved were Captain Phelps, Martin Adams, first mate;
James Warden, second mate; Elijah Butler, and Louis Almeira.</p>

<p>On the 20th of November, 1848, the schooner Welcome
Return, from Charlottetown, bound for Boston, went ashore
in a gale at Rocky Hill. She had as passengers, John and
Mary Burns and six children: Ellen, 11; Catherine, 9; Henry,
7; Mary, 5; Rose, 3; and Sarah, six months old. The father
and mother and infant were saved, and all the others lost.
The father and mother died in Taunton, and the infant,
Sarah A., is living in Plymouth, the widow of John H. Parsons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>The next wreck I remember occurred on Friday, January
25, 1867, at Gunners’ Point at Manomet. A gale with snow
set in Wednesday night, and the railroad was so blocked that
no trains ran through to Boston until Sunday, and the train
from Boston Wednesday night reached no further than Halifax,
where the passengers were supplied with refreshments.
The flag staff in Shirley Square was blown down, as well as
those at Pilgrim Hall and at the Cordage Factory, and also
the store house of the Cordage Works. Considerable damage
was done at the wharves, and the schooner Thatcher Taylor
was capsized, and her masts were carried away. The bark
Velma from Smyrna, October 18th, Zenas Nickerson of
Chatham, master, entered the bay on Thursday morning, and
during the early part of the gale, headed northeast with the
wind southeast, and finally struck at two o’clock Friday
morning, a half a mile off shore. Beating over the ledge she
came within twenty rods of the beach, and swung round with
her head to the sea. The crew took to the mizzen rigging.
A little before daylight the steward, unable to longer hold on,
fell overboard, carrying with him another of the crew, and
both were lost. The main mast soon fell, carrying also the
mizzen above the men, and through the forenoon the survivors
succeeded in holding on. At two o’clock in the afternoon
Henry B. Holmes, Paran Bartlett, James Bartlett, James
Lynch, Henry Briggs, Otis Nichols, Robert Reamy and Octavius
Reamy, reached the vessel and saved the remainder
of the crew as follows: Zenas Nickerson
of Chatham, master; Starks Nickerson of
Chatham, first mate; John G. Allen of New Bedford, second
mate; Augustus L. Jenkins of Portsmouth, John Florida of
New York, John Perry of Lisbon and Joseph Sylvia of Boston.
The names of the two men lost were William Sampson,
England, and Manuel Gustres of Pico, Western Islands. The
men were carried to the Manomet House, and when stripped,
one called Jack was found to have on seven undershirts and
four pairs of stockings. Dr. Alexander Jackson of Plymouth,
and Dr. C. J. Wood of Chiltonville, the father of Gen. Leonard
Wood, who was then practicing in Chiltonville, attended the
men, and performed a number of necessary amputations.
While they were under treatment I visited them several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
and rendered such assistance as I was able. The vessel belonged
to G. W. Bisbee, and her cargo consisted of 1245 cases
of figs; 1120 boxes do; 7,937 drums, do; 3,527 mats, do;
1,340 drums of Sultana raisins; 7 casks of prunes; 108 bales
of wool; 180 bags of canary seed; 6 cases of gum tragacanth;
3,070 pieces of logwood; 50 cases of figs; 8,407 cases, and
1,587 drums, do, the consignees of which were Baker &amp; Morrell,
Ryder &amp; Hardy, and the captain.</p>

<p>In the same gale the schooner Shooting Star, Captain Coe,
with corn from Newcastle, Delaware, for Salem, went ashore
at Saquish, and was lost.</p>

<p>In 1873 the schooner Daniel Webster, loaded with iron,
went ashore on Brown’s Island, and was a total loss.</p>

<p>The brig John R. Rhodes, loaded with corn, was wrecked
in the outer harbor in the winter of 1850-1. The wreck was
bought by John D. Churchill and others, and after repairs in
Boston was sold.</p>

<p>In previous chapters I have mentioned Samuel Doten in
connection with the escape of Plymouth vessels from the embargo,
but I have not by any means done with him. He was
the son of Samuel and Eunice (Robbins) Doten, and was born
in 1783. His father had three wives, and twenty-three children,
the oldest of whom was Samuel, born in 1783, and the
youngest, James, born in 1829. Captain Doten in early life
was an enterprising shipmaster, later a builder and owner of
vessels engaged in the grand bank fishery, and finally a lumber
merchant on Doten’s yard and wharf, the latter of which he
built not far from 1825. He was a man of commanding figure,
judicious, active, and prompt, selected many times to serve as
chief marshal at celebrations of the Pilgrim Society and town.
He married in 1807 Rebecca, daughter of Nathaniel Bradford,
and died September 8, 1861. Two of his sons, Major
Samuel H. and Captain Charles C., will be noticed in a later
chapter in connection with the civil war. Captain Doten was
engaged in the privateer service during the war of 1812, and
the following narrative of some of his experiences in that service
may be interesting to my readers. For its incidents, and
for extracts from his log and diary, I am indebted to Captain
Charles C. Doten, his son.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>During the war of 1812, as in that of the Revolution, the
government of the United States issued “letters of marque,”
giving authority to private individuals to build, arm, and man
vessels, for the purpose of making reprisals upon and destroying
the enemy’s commerce. While these “privateers,” as they
were called, were entirely outside of and unconnected with
the regular naval force of the country, they became one of the
most potent weapons wielded on the high seas in behalf of
the government. Their destructiveness to English commerce
made them the dread of the ocean, for the daring men who
engaged in privateering enterprises were the best shipmasters
and seamen of their day, perfectly familiar with all coast
ports and the highways of the sea, so they knew where to
strike most effectively for their own advantage. A vessel captured
under the English flag, became, with her cargo, the lawful
prize of her captors, and the proceeds of sale were divided
under established rules among the owners, officers and men
of the privateer, the business in many instances being very
profitable. The English commercial vessels likewise armed
for defence, and quite often there were spirited engagements
before the English Jack would be lowered to the Stars and
Stripes flown by some saucy, fast sailing Yankee brig, or long,
low, rakish schooner of the Baltimore clipper type.</p>

<p>France being friendly to the United States, her ports were
open to our privateers and their prizes, so the English channel
itself, right under the nose, of Great Britain, was a tempting
cruising ground where our letters of marque made many a
successful venture and some of them came to grief in capture
by the English men-of-war.</p>

<p>As has been previously said in this series of reminiscences,
Plymouth had her full number of adventurous spirits, and
her “men of the sea” on board the many privateers, sailing
from southern and northern ports. On two vessels, however,
the “Leo” and the “George Little,” fitted at Boston, the crews
were largely made up of Plymouth men, so they may be regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
as the “Plymouth privateers” of 1812. Of the “Leo’s”
career we have no detailed knowledge, but it has been told us
that Captain Harvey Weston, Captain Robert Hutchinson,
Captain John Chase, Captain Nat Bartlett and others from
this town whose names are not known, were members of her
company, and that she took several prizes before she herself
was forced to surrender over on the English coast. Her men
were imprisoned for the rest of the war period, some of them
being sent to the horrible Dartmoor prison of England, of
which history says that the dreadful tales of suffering and
death in the “black hole” and massacre by the guards are all
too truthful, but the “Leo’s” men were not there when the
prison was at its very worst.</p>

<p>The “George Little” was a smart hermaphrodite brig,
mounting ten guns and a “chaser,” and was owned and fitted
at Boston. Her commander was Captain Nathaniel Spooner;
first lieutenant, Captain Samuel Doten; second lieutenant,
William Holmes, and third lieutenant, — Turner, all of Plymouth.
The crew list contained the names of many of our
townsmen, but as it was not preserved, only those of Jacob
Morton, William Hammatt and William Stacy are now remembered.
A private log book of the voyage was kept by
first lieutenant Doten, and is now in possession of his son,
Captain Charles C. Doten, the first entry being: Monday, December
26, 1814, at 2 p. m., passed Boston light, fresh gale,
north by east, and extreme cold. At 3 p. m. chased by one of
His Majesty’s gun brigs, and outsailed her with ease.</p>

<p>At that time there was a fleet of British men-of-war cruising
along the American coast from Maine to Virginia, several
frigates and gun brigs making rendezvous at Provincetown,
and often coming over near the Gurnet, thence running up
off Boston and along the Cape Ann shore. It was from one
of these brigs that the “George Little” so easily escaped and
got to sea. The log has daily entries, that of January 7, 1815,
recording that William Stacy fell from the top gallant mast
head, sending down royal yard, by the royal mast pitch
poling, and was saved on topsail yard.” “January 12, at 6.25
a. m., made a sail four leagues away, and set chase. At 11.30
she fired a lee gun—11.40 fired another, and set English
colors—11.55, seeing American colors she fired her stern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
chasers in good direction for us, but without effect, they falling
short, and in a moment struck. Proved to be the ship
“Mary,” six guns and eighteen men, James Bags, master,
from New Foundland with fish for Lisbon. 13th took some
articles from the prize, put Mr. Turner and nine men on
board, and ordered her to proceed for first port in the United
States.”</p>

<p>It may here be stated that the “Mary” arrived safely at
Marblehead, where with her cargo she was sold, yielding to
the “George Little’s” owners and men a good amount of prize
money. The “Mary’s” crew, being two to one of the “Little’s”
men put on board, attempted to retake her, but after a severe
fight were driven below, and Jacob Morton of Plymouth, who
was a powerful man, drew the companion slide over them,
and upon it placed a large anchor, lifting alone the weight
which two ordinary men would have found a test of their
strength.</p>

<p>The “George Little” held on her course across the ocean,
intending to cruise in the English channel and take her prizes,
if any were there secured, into French ports. Off the Azores
or Western Islands, January 21st and 22d, she chased a vessel
but lost her. January 28 she overhauled the Prussian
schooner “Ferwarhting,” from St. Michael’s for Hamburg
with fruit, and put Captain Bags, his son and mate of the
“Mary” on board.</p>

<p>“February 2 overhauled Prussian brig, “Ann Elizabeth,”
from London to St. Michael’s, in ballast. Put four prisoners
on board and ordered her to proceed. Lost both boats boarding,
but saved all the men.”</p>

<p>February 4th and 5th the privateer brig was in chase of a
sloop, which escaped in the darkness of the second night, and
the next day the “George Little” met her own fate, the log
reading as follows: “February 6, made a sail on our lee bow,
which gave chase at 8.30. Bore away, made all sail, supposing
her to be a frigate. At 9 she fired her bow chaser, which
fell short. At 10 her shot went over us. At 11.30, finding
no means of escape, we reluctantly struck our colors to His
Majesty’s ship “Granicus” of 36 guns, Captain William Furlong
Wise. So was lost the “George Little,” in my opinion
for the want of those necessaries to induce one and all to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
their best to save her, as we were short of bread, beef—poor
rum—generally spirits sunk—this is the effect of too much
economy privateering. So ends these 24 hours, rainy, and
overpowering all with heavy hearts.”</p>

<p>The closing remarks above would indicate that the owners
of the “George Little” had not been liberal in fitting out the
vessel, and in consequence some discontent had existed on
board. The “Granicus” took the prisoners to Gibraltar, where
they were placed with others on hulks anchored in the harbor,
and kept during March. On the 26th of that month “His
Majesty’s ship Eurylaus from the Chesapeake, arrived with
news of the ratification of peace between the United States
and Great Britain,” and on the 29th the prisoners were embarked
for England in the “Eurylaus,” arriving at Plymouth
April 16th. Captain Doten’s memorandum becomes personal
after that date, and relates that on the 17th he was sent on
board the “Ganges” 74, and on the 21st “had intelligence of the
arrival of the Mary at Marblehead, by an American paper of
February 24.” April 24, he says he “obtained permission to go
on shore from the Ganges,” and May 3d, “smuggled myself
on board the ‘Royal Sovereign,’ Captain Spence, bound to
Boston as a cartel”—a vessel commissioned to exchange prisoners.
The “Royal Sovereign” had 400 prisoners, and as she
was coming direct to Boston, Captain Doten, not being included
in the list, took his chances as a stowaway. The vessel
sailed from Plymouth, England, May 4th, and arrived in Boston
after a passage of 35 days. In crossing the Grand Banks
the schooner “Almira” of Provincetown was spoken, 25 days
from home, with 10,000 fish.</p>

<p>A personal expense account appended to Captain Doten’s
journal of the “George Little’s” cruise shows that at Gibraltar
he spent $51.25, among the items being $15.25 for provisions,
and $1.00 for liquor, a proportion which certainly was very
moderate for those days. On board the “Ganges” his expenses
were $14.95, and at Plymouth, $105.63, mostly for clothing,
and passage home. The latter, seven pounds, was probably
paid to Captain Spence for not finding him on board until the
“Royal Sovereign” was at sea. The total of $171.83 paid out
on account of capture, was recouped with a fair margin of
profit from his share of the prize money of the “Mary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>The lack of facilities for quick transmission of news at
that time, is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the treaty
to end the war was signed at Ghent, December 24, 1814, two
days before the “George Little” sailed from Boston, so her
entire cruise was made in a period of unknown peace. The
battle of New Orleans, in which the British were defeated
with a loss of 2,000 men, including the death of their commanding
general, Edward Pakenham, was fought January 8,
1815, two weeks after the agreement on articles of peace,
which at the present time would have been known all over
the world within a few minutes of their adoption.</p>

<p>It was a custom for old shipmasters and seamen, after their
seafaring days were over, occasionally to meet in Captain
Doten’s counting room at the head of what is now Captain E.
B. Atwood’s wharf, and while a wild northeaster howled outside
they would toast their shins at a good fire, smoke their
pipes, and spin yarns of privateering days, or their experiences
in various voyages to the West Indies or ports across
the ocean. There could be no keener enjoyment to those of
younger generations than to sit while all was blue about them
from the tobacco exhalations, and listen to these “tales of the
sea” from men who were veritable actors in the scenes so
vividly recalled. Two incidents pertaining to Captain Doten’s
cruise in the “George Little,” as her first lieutenant, thus came
out, not written in his journal. When at the time of her capture
by the “Granicus” the American flag was hauled down
on the “George Little,” Lieutenant Doten was not only chagrined,
but wrathy, and swore that he wouldn’t surrender his
sword to any Englishman, so he broke it across his knee. The
boarding officer from the “Granicus” on finding him without
side arms to give up, at once declared him not entitled to
consideration, and ordered him ironed. This was done, and
in that condition, with Captain Spooner, he was taken to the
“Granicus.” To the great surprise of the boarding officer who
had thus thought to humiliate him, he was greeted by Captain
Wise of the frigate as he stepped on the deck with, “Hallo,
Sam! what have you got those on for?” “Because I was a
fool and broke my sword,” was the response, at which Captain
Wise laughed and called the master-at-arms to relieve him
of the “bracelets,” bidding him go to the private cabin. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
Captain Wise soon joined him, and over a bottle of the best,
they renewed the acquaintance of some years before, when
Captain Doten, then master of the brig “Dragon” of Plymouth,
Mass., had sailed for three years in succession under
convoy of Captain Wise, engaged in carrying naval stores up
the Baltic from Plymouth, England, the “Dragon” having
been chartered by the British government among other
merchant vessels for that purpose. This service brought Captain
Doten into quite intimate relations with many of the
English naval officers, so that when he was a prisoner at
Gibraltar, he was allowed many privileges. Among these was
shore going almost daily, and passage through the batteries
to the top of the Rock, where he could spend the time more
agreeably than on the prison hulk. One day in going up he
found Lieutenant Daly, who was in charge of one of the batteries,
unshotting the guns, and was told by him that some
ships in the offing were from America and signalled that the
British had won a great victory, in honor of which he was
ordered to fire a salute when the details were known. Much
depressed in spirits, Captain Doten listened during the day
for the salute, but it was not fired. Returning in the afternoon,
Daly was then engaged in reshotting the guns, and explained
that when the ships got nearer, the fortress had learned that
there indeed had been a great battle “at a place called New
Orleans,” but it had resulted in a tremendous defeat for the
British arms, and General Pakenham had been “sent home in
a hogshead of rum.” Daly—who of course was an Irishman—added
at a low breath, “and I’m glad of it.” Captain Doten
told the great news to his fellow prisoners on the hulk, and
that night after they had been confined below the gratings
one of their number, a ship carpenter, who had located where
a barrel of beer rested on the deck, bored up through the
planks and bilge of the cask, inserting an improvised tube or
pipe, and drew off the contents. Of course a great deal ran
to waste, but enough was secured to make all hands feel
mighty “merry,” and they hilariously celebrated the victory of
New Orleans, taunting the guard so outrageously, singing
“Yankee Doodle,” and bandying epithets, that they were only
partially quieted by the gratings being removed, the guard
drawn up around the hatchways with muskets pointed down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
into the crowd, and the threat made to fire if the disturbance
did not cease. Undoubtedly there would have been shooting,
but the English officers had heard rumors of peace, and under
such circumstances the killing of unarmed prisoners would
have been deemed murder. They “made a night of it,” and
the next day, when the loss of the beer was discovered, the
cause of their high spirits was explained, while the shrewd
manner in which they had obtained the liquid for the jollification,
was characterized by the commander of the hulk, as
“another d—d smart Yankee trick.”</p>

<p>During the passage of the Royal Sovereign bringing home
400 prisoners, she was caught in a heavy gale near the Grand
Banks, but Captain Spence, her commander, was a good seaman,
and made a safe arrival at Boston.</p>

<p>During my youth the house now occupied by Miss Perkins,
the daughter of the late John Perkins, was owned and occupied
by George Drew, who has already been noticed. He built
the hotel which stood on the corner of Middle street, and besides
conducting a stable on that street, was largely engaged
in the management of the Boston line of stages. Among
other children he had a son, John Glover Drew, who was one
of my playmates and schoolmates. John Glover was afflicted
at times with a singular infirmity which like paralysis of the
vocal organs would for the space of fifteen minutes disable
him from uttering a word. I remember once his receiving a
flogging for not answering a question put to him by the
teacher the first time an attack occurred in school. I had a
classmate at Harvard who for a time was affected in the same
way, but in both cases the infirmity finally disappeared.</p>

<p>George Drew had a brother, Thomas, known as Dr. Drew,
though I never knew of his practicing medicine, who for many
years rendered important service in the educational field in
Plymouth. Besides teaching a private school, he was in conjunction
with Benjamin Drew, a teacher in the school in town
square, and, when what was called the town school was established
in 1827, and a school house built in that year for
its accommodation in School street, opposite the rear land of
the Davis building lot, he was selected as its teacher. He was
also town clerk from 1818 to 1840, succeeding Deacon
Ephraim Spooner in that office. He had a son, Thomas, three
years older than myself, one of the old boys in the High school
when I entered it in 1832. Tom was a bright fellow, and for
many years performed valuable service as a journalist in the
offices of the Worcester <cite>Spy</cite> and the Boston <cite>Herald</cite>. While
William H. Lord was the teacher of the High school, a gentleman,
by the way, very popular with the boys, and one who
always enjoyed a joke, it was the custom at the opening of the
school in the morning for the scholars to rise in turn and repeat
a verse of scripture. On the morning after it became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
known that the teacher was engaged to Miss Persis Kendall,
the daughter of Rev. Dr. Kendall, Tom rose in his place and
said, “Salute Persis, the beloved of the Lord.”</p>

<p>John Perkins, a later occupant of the house under consideration,
son of John and Sarah (Adams) Perkins of Kingston,
married in 1825 Adeline Tupper of Kingston, and established
himself as a hatter in Plymouth, where he ever after made his
home. He was many years a constable of the town, and
Deputy Sheriff, and in the year 1856 he was Sheriff of Plymouth
county. While constable and deputy, I have reason to
know, as chairman of the Board of Selectmen during a long
period, that he performed his duties with firmness, and at the
same time with great discretion. For instance in arresting
men for drunkenness, especially in cases where the offence
was unusual or perhaps accidental, he was careful not to disgrace
them by a public exhibition of their weakness, and often
led them by circuitous routes to their homes, exacting the
promise of a reform which rougher treatment would have
tended to prevent. On one occasion, however, his usual discretion
failed him. It was during the civil war when it was
feared that confederate emissaries gathered in Canada might
by secret invasion of our towns cause widespread damage by
extensive conflagrations. While in Boston one afternoon I
was informed by Alexander Holmes, President of the Old
Colony Railroad, that he had been notified by the chief of
police of Boston that an invasion of our coast towns was expected
that night, and that extraordinary precautions had been
ordered for the protection of public buildings and lumber
yards, wharves and freight houses. As I had an appointment
in Boston that evening and could not return home, I telegraphed
to Mr. Perkins to place a dozen or fifteen watchmen
in various places, stating my reason, but telling him to say
nothing about it for fear of a popular alarm. When I came
home the next day I was a little mortified to find that the
story had been told, and that the whole town had been through
the night in a fever of excitement, and consternation. I consoled
myself, however, with the belief that I had done my
duty and would have been unable to justify myself if I had
failed to act on the information received, and any untoward
act had occurred. The same precautions were taken in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
cities on the coast, but with less notoriety. Mr. Perkins died
August 20, 1877.</p>

<p>There was another alarm which occurred in 1871 or 1872,
which it may be well to mention here of which nothing was
known except by those immediately concerned. A letter was
received from New York at the Plymouth Bank, of which I
was president, in which the writer stated that he had overheard
a plan to enter and rob the bank on or about a certain night,
and advised that proper precautions be taken. Watchmen
were placed in my house, and in that of the cashier, and extra
watchmen in the bank. In those days it was frequently the
plan for bank burglars to secure the officers having the keys,
and carrying them to the bank to force them to open the safe.
The bank watchmen were consequently instructed to admit no
one to the bank on any pretense, even if accompanied by the
officers themselves. After I think the second or third night
of watching, the writer of the letter appeared at the bank, and
said that the plan had been given up. The men in New York
had either heard from their pal, who had been some time in
Plymouth, that he had discovered indications of unusual precautions
on the part of the bank, or for some other reason
had decided to abandon the scheme. If the writer of the letter
had demanded or asked for money, his story might have
been thought a fake, but as he betrayed no wish for compensation,
and was perfectly satisfied with the payment of twenty-five
dollars for his expenses, I came to the conclusion that he
was a stool pigeon, under pay from the New York police, and
neither asked nor expected pay from the bank.</p>

<p>An actual entry of the bank occurred on the 13th of January,
1830. Pelham Winslow Warren, brother of the late
Dr. Winslow Warren of Plymouth, about to leave town for a
season to attend to his duties as clerk of the Massachusetts
House of Representatives, deposited for safe keeping his silver
and plate in the vault in the basement of the bank, whose
place of business was at that time the southerly end of the
building which stood where the Russell building now stands.
The deposit consisted of nine silver table spoons, twelve silver
teaspoons, two silver ladles, one pair of silver sugar tongs,
one silver toast rack, one silver fish knife; and these plated articles,
one coffee pot, one teapot, one sugar dish, one cream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
pot, one cake basket, and two pairs of candlesticks, all of
which were marked J. T., the initials of Jeanette Taylor, the
maiden name of Mr. Warren’s wife. All of the above articles
were stolen, and the entry was made through a back
window by means of a short ladder, evidently cut from a longer
one, the other part of which was afterwards found in the
back yard of a resident of the town. None of the property
of the bank was missing, except a roll of twenty ten cent
pieces, which happened to be in the basement vault. It was
evident that the burglar knew of the deposit of the silver, and
was probably a Plymouth man, as no attempt was made to
enter the safe in the banking room. Strong suspicions were
entertained of a man, whom I remember very well, but no
arrest was ever made.</p>

<p>For many years the two houses next but two north of the
Perkins house, were at different times owned and occupied
by Johnson Davie, who was a son of Solomon and Jedidah
(Sylvester) Davie. He was a mason by trade, and married
in 1823, Phebe, daughter of Ephraim Finney. He was one
of the water commissioners who made a contract with the Jersey
City cement pipe company to lay the pipe for the Plymouth
water works. In the performance of his duties as commissioner
he rendered important service to both the town and
the company by following with trowel in hand the laying of
the pipe and assuring himself that every foot had a sufficient
covering of cement properly mixed and laid. He was a man
of brains, and used them so that he often found himself encountering
public opinion, which was said by Carlyle to be
the opinion of fools. He died December 25, 1882. Ezra
Johnson Davee, his son, born in 1824, entered about 1840 the
counting room of Langdon &amp; Co., a Boston house in the
Smyrna trade, and after a few years, on the death of the
Smyrna bookkeeper he was sent out to take charge of the business
until another man could be sent out to take his place.
He has been there ever since either managing the affairs of
Langdon &amp; Co., or his own for more than forty years, visiting
his family in Plymouth about once in five years. I made
a passage with him in 1895 in the Cephalonia on his return
from one of these visits, and now in 1905 he has just sailed
August 1, in the Ivernia for Liverpool, at the age of eighty-one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
with the vigor of middle life scarcely impaired. He
married in Smyrna Betsey Ghout and Amelia Marion Ghout,
the latter accompanying him on his late visit home.</p>

<p>The northerly house of the two owned by Mr. Davee was
kept as a public house, under the name of the Old Colony
House for some years prior to 1871, by N. M. Perry, who was
a native of either Norfolk or Worcester county. He had previously
kept the Mansion House on the corner of North and
Court streets, and later after living in Whitman a short time,
he returned to Plymouth and kept what is now the Plymouth
Rock House, called by him the Old Colony House, where he
died July 17, 1877.</p>

<p>Coomer Weston of whom I next speak, was the son of
Coomer and Patty (Cole) Weston, and was born in 1784.
He was the keeper of the jail some years, which position he
resigned in 1829, and moved into the house now occupied by
Mrs. Wm. S. Danforth, where he lived until 1839 or 1840,
when he built a house on the corner of Court street and
Faunce’s lane, now Allerton street, where he died July 7,
1870. He was the first captain of the Standish Guards.
During the last thirty years of his life he was interested in
raising fruit, especially apples and pears, and in horticulture.
He married in 1804 Hannah, daughter of Jabez Doten, and had
Coomer, 1805, who was also at one time captain of the Standish
Guards; Francis Henri, 1807, an enterprising shipmaster;
Hannah Doten, 1809; Ann Maria, 1813; Lydia, 1818; Thomas,
1821, a clergyman settled at various times in various towns,
and our townsman, Myles Standish Weston.</p>

<p>In 1849 Lemuel Bradford opened a store called the North
end grocery, where the Cold Spring Grocery store now stands,
and up to that time there were only three stores where there
are now twenty-seven between North street and the Kingston
line. At the date above mentioned there were two hotels in
the town, while now there are six open all the year, and
four more open only during the summer. As an indication
of the extension of the town towards the North, it may be
stated that while in 1880 the center of population was in the
center of Leyden, Market and Summer streets, it was in 1900,
at the house of Capt. E. B. Atwood on Court street. It is
probable that it will be found under the last census to be still
further North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>In a modest house a little beyond the North end grocery on
the east side of the street there lived for many years one of
the uncles of the town. Every town has its uncles, and
wherever you find them they are sterling, upright men, who
have a kindly and affectionate word for and from everybody.
Peter Holmes was the man known only as Uncle Peter, a shipmaster
in his early days who sailed for my grandfather, and
whose letters written from foreign ports, which I have read,
show him to have been skilful and trusted in his profession.
My young readers will be fortunate if they find as worthy a
man as my old Uncle Peter. He died July 17, 1869. He
married in 1801 Sally, daughter of Lazarus Harlow, and had
five sons, one of whom was our late townsman, Peter Holmes,
who lived in the house now occupied by Dr. Brown on North
street, and six daughters, two of whom married our venerable
townsman, William Rider Drew.</p>

<p>There was another uncle, Uncle Lem, sailmaker by trade,
whose soul was as white as the canvas on which he worked.
He was the son of Lemuel and Abigail (Pierce) Simmons,
and was born in 1790. He married in 1818 Priscilla, daughter
of Thomas Sherman, and died December 6, 1863. No
truer inscription was ever cut on a gravestone than that which
says in simple, unaffected words that, “he was universally beloved
and respected; honest and upright, with a cheerful,
pleasant manner, and a kind, benevolent heart. To know
him was to love him.”</p>

<p>There was still another uncle of whom I am glad of an
opportunity to say a word as the tribute of a friend to his
memory. Uncle Ed. Watson, the Lord of the Isle, was in
many respects a remarkable man. Born and bred on Clark’s
Island at the entrance of Plymouth harbor about four miles
from town, and eighty acres in extent, he there spent his life
a sailor and fisherman when occasion demanded, always a
farmer familiar with the secrets which nature is ready to disclose
to her lovers, a poet of no mean acquirements, and above
all a student of the events of the world, a philosopher who
acted his philosophy without preaching it, and who as much
deserves the title of sage as some who in a broader field won
a more notorious name. He did not talk philosophy as Hawthorne
described Emerson and Thoreau talking it, leaning on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
their hoes in the garden with Alcott sitting on the fence discoursing
on the “Why and the Wherefore,” but as he laboriously
tilled the soil he recognized in every stone and worm
and blade of grass the prodigality of nature, and in every annual
bloom of the buttercup and rose a lesson of obedience to
the laws of God. He said to me once, “Oh, Mr. Davis, if all
were as obedient to the divine will as the blossoms on yonder
apple tree, by Geo. Germain, what a world this would be.”
In his island home he was hospitable to the last degree. Visitors
came to his grounds as if they were public, and if friends
were among them he dropped his hoe or spade or scythe to entertain
them when his labor in the field could ill be spared, and
perhaps invited them to partake of his noonday meal, but like
Sir Roderick:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>I was one day at Plymouth Rock with Wm. E. Forster, who
had recently distinguished himself by his efforts in parliament
in favor of the educational bill, when Mr. Watson came up
the wharf with a kinnerkin in one hand, and a pair of chickens
in the other. I introduced him to Mr. Foster as a member
of the English parliament, and he asked if the gentleman was
Wm. E. Forster—Forster, with an “r,” and when assured that
he was, he said, “I am glad to see you. I know all about you,
that last education speech you made hit the nail on the head.”
The two then engaged in conversation on English affairs, and
after they separated I pointed out to Mr. Forster the island on
which Mr. Watson was born, and had always lived, having
had only a schooling of three months in all his life. “You
astonish me,” he replied, adding, “why that man knows more
about English politics than three-fourths of the members of
parliament.”</p>

<p>To give him his full name, Edward Winslow Watson, son
of John and Lucia Marston Watson, was born December 17,
1797, and died where he was born, August 8, 1876. His
funeral was unique and impressive. The green bottom lap
streak boat in which many hundreds of times he had stemmed
the winds and tide was the catafalque which bore him to
town, while the boats of his island and Saquish and Gurnet
friends, like white-winged angels, attended him to his rest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
In closing this notice of my friend I will quote from his little
book of poems lines illustrating the serious thought which his
mind evolved from the most trifling incidents of life:</p>

<p>I speak next of the Samoset House estate, not for the purpose
of following its title, but for the purpose of speaking of its
occupants at various times. As long ago as I remember the estate
extended from Court street up Wood’s Lane to what is now
Allerton street. Its Court street line extended by the line of
the present gutter, the street being widened afterwards by cutting
off a strip of that and adjoining estates on the north.
There was a high, close board fence along the street, which I
remember because when a boy I brought up against it a runaway
horse which I was riding. The house on the estate was
what is now the old part of the Samoset, and was owned and
occupied by Mrs. Betsey H. Hodge and her father, Dr. Jas.
Thacher, until 1827. It faced the south, and was reached by
a driveway from Wood’s Lane, and its spacious yard was
bounded on the southwest by a carriage house and barn, a
handsome lawn lying along Court street. The estate called
La Grange was altogether the most aristocratic one in town,
and at the above date, with the exception of the old Merrick
Ryder house on the southeast corner of the Mixter lot, and an
old red house on the corner of Lothrop Place, no houses were
in sight at the north. In 1827, Dr. Thacher moved into the
easterly part of the Winslow house on North street, and the estate
was sold to Charles Sever, who married in that year Mrs.
Hodge’s daughter Jane. Mr. Sever was a Kingston man,
brother of Col. John and James N. Sever, and as I have no
recollection of his connection with any business in Plymouth,
I think he must have been associated with his brothers in navigation
and foreign trade. In 1833 Mr. Sever sold the estate
to John Thomas, and moved temporarily into the house on
Middle street next below Mr. Beaman’s undertaker’s establishment,
while he was building the Sever house on Russell street,
which he did not live to occupy, but which was occupied by his
family until the recent death of his daughter Catherine.</p>

<p>In 1837 Mr. Thomas sold the estate to Jason Hart, and removed
to New York. His business connections in that city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
and his death in Irvington, have been referred to in a previous
chapter. Mr. Hart has been already noticed as a member of
the firm of Hart and Alderman, and in business alone where
the store of H. H. Cole on Main street now stands.</p>

<p>In 1844 the Old Colony Railroad corporation then building
their road from Boston to Plymouth, bought the estate and
built and furnished the Samoset House, which was opened in
1845, under the management of Joseph Stetson, who was employed
by the road for the purpose. Mr. Stetson was succeeded
by James S. Parker and Henry C. Tribou, under the
firm name of Parker &amp; Tribou, who kept it under the
direction of the railroad until 1850. In that year the house
and furniture were sold to the Samoset House Association,
who leased it until 1878, at various times to the following persons
in the order named: Granville Gardner and Henry C.
Tribou, under the firm name of Gardner &amp; Tribou, James S.
Parker, A. &amp; N. Hoxie, Comfort Whiting and Peleg C. Chandler.
In 1878, while Mr. Chandler was lessee, he bought the estate,
and in 1882 his widow sold it, exclusive of house lots at its
westerly end to T. F. Frobisher. In 1883 Mr. Frobisher sold
the above remaining estate to Daniel H. Maynard, who sold
it a few years ago to the present proprietors, James S. Clark
and the late Edward E. Green doing business under the firm
name of Clark &amp; Green.</p>

<p>While I am wandering about the North part of the town, let
me speak of Bourne Spooner, who having been dead thirty-five
years, cannot be remembered by any of my readers who are
much less than fifty years of age. Few are aware to whom
the town was indebted, for the establishment of the Plymouth
Cordage Co., a corporation filling so large a place among the
industries of the town, and which with its growing proportions
promises to stand many years as a conspicuous and deserved
monument to his memory. He was a son of Nathaniel and
Mary (Holmes) Spooner, and was born in Plymouth, February
2, 1790. After receiving the education which our public
schools could furnish, he went to New Orleans, where he spent
ten years engaged in rope making, but in what capacity I have
no means of knowing. It is probable that the material used
in the manufacture was Kentucky hemp, as its transportation
from the hemp fields by the Mississippi river was easy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
cheap. It is doubtful whether sisal from Mexico was much
used in those days and Russia hemp and Manilla could be obtained
in Boston more expeditiously and cheaper than in New
Orleans. The unprofitableness of slave labor employed in
that city appealed to his Yankee spirit of thrift, and he conceived
the idea of establishing if possible a cordage factory in
his native town. Returning home he kept for a time a store
opposite the Green, and later conferred with a number of gentlemen
in Boston, who looked favorably on the scheme of a
Plymouth factory, and on the 12th of July, 1824, an act of incorporation
was granted by the Massachusetts legislature to
Bourne Spooner, William Lovering, Jr., John Dodd and John
Russell, and their associates, as the Plymouth Cordage Company,
with power to hold real estate not exceeding twenty
thousand dollars. The location decided upon for the factory
was in the north part of Plymouth, on a stream supplied by
two brooks, one of which was called Nathans brook, after Nathan
Holmes, the grandfather of Gideon F. Holmes, the present
treasurer of the company, the capacity of which was
twenty horse power. Thus it seems evident that any very
considerable growth of the establishment was not anticipated.
The part of Plymouth selected for the factory was called in
Pilgrim days, “Plain Dealing,” but in my boyhood, Bungtown,
and a little later, North Town. When the Old Colony Railroad
established a station there they unwittingly adopted
practically the old Pilgrim “Seaside,” as “Plain Dealing”
meant a plain by the sea. The growth of business set in at a
very early day, and up to 1883, when the capital stock of the
company was increased to half a million of dollars, only forty-four
thousand dollars had been paid in, and all the remainder
of the half million had been furnished by the profits of the
company. In 1894 the capital was still further increased to
a million, all of the increase being furnished by the stockholders.
To meet the growth of the factory business the original
water power was supplemented by steam engines in 1837, 1839,
1850, 1868, 1888, and 1900. The last two of these are of
1500 and 1600 horse power. In 1827 the sales of cordage
amounted to 601,023 pounds, and in 1899 to 19,597,644
pounds. In addition to the above, while the first lot of binding
twine sold in 1882 amounted to 384,820 pounds, the sales<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of the same in 1899 amounted to 27,905,981 pounds, and the
entire product of the factory is estimated to be about one-seventh
of the product of all the Cordage companies in the
United States. Of the large cables made by the Company I
have personal knowledge of one of fifteen or fifteen and a half
inches. About the year 1865, an English steamer, named, I
think, “Concordia,” was wrecked on Cape Cod and bought by
Boston parties. The cable, to which I refer, was ordered for
the purpose of hauling her off shore. I was told by Osborne
Howes, one of the purchasers that within forty-eight hours after
it was coiled on the beach the junk men cut it up and carried
it off. The steamer was got off and towed to Boston,
where she was lengthened and refitted for service.</p>

<p>I have said thus much concerning the Cordage Company for
the purpose of illustrating the sagacity, energy, good judgment
and integrity of Mr. Spooner, who was until his death, during
the career of the company, its agent, and after 1837, its treasurer.
He did his business so unostentatiously, that I think
few of his fellow citizens realized the great work he was doing
in building up an industry which has done so much in promoting
the growth and welfare of Plymouth. Next to his
interest in the affairs of the company intrusted to his care,
was his interest in the anti-slavery cause. How, and exactly
when he enlisted in the cause, I never knew. His life in New
Orleans probably opened his eyes to the evils of the institution
of slavery, but I do not think that he entered the anti-slavery
ranks until after the visit of George Thompson to Massachusetts,
and the Garrison mob in Boston in 1835. Among the
earliest in Plymouth to engage in the movement, according to
my best recollections were, Lemuel Stephens, William Stephens,
Ichabod Morton, Edwin Morton, Ephraim Harlow,
Kendall Holmes, George Adams and Deacon Wm. Putnam
Ripley, and I think Johnson Davie and their families. Nearly
all of these, except the Ripleys, lived on “tother side,” as it
was called, like “l’autre cote” of Paris the other side of the
Seine, as our “tother side” is the other side of Town Brook.
The merchants, professional men, including ministers, and
the politicians in both the whig and democratic parties,
were either too timid to join the anti-slavery ranks,
or were decidedly hostile to the anti-slavery movement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
An anti-slavery meeting was held on the evening
of July 4, 1835, in the Robinson church, which was disturbed
by an incipient mob which contented itself with breaking a few
windows, and afterwards smearing with tar the dry goods
sign of Deacon Ripley. Though the <span class="smcap">Old Colony Memorial</span>
contained a paid advertisement of the meeting, its columns
were silent concerning its doings and the disturbance.
It is of little consequence how or when Mr. Spooner became
interested in the movement. He became one of the most prominent
men in the state, supporting it, and undoubtedly furnished
to it material aid not exceeded in amount by the contributions
of any other in its ranks. He was a constant friend
and supporter of Garrison, Phillips, Quincy and Douglas, all
of whom frequently enjoyed the hospitalities of his home.</p>

<p>Mr. Spooner was widely known, especially by fellow travellers
on the railroad, as an expert and entertaining story teller,
and skilful in the art. He knew how to tell a story, omitting
details, careful never to say that he had a capital story, being
willing to leave its quality to the judgment of his listeners,
never laughing until he had finished, and then when his companions
began to laugh he would join with them as heartily
as if he had never told the story before. He told many stories
about his great uncle, Deacon Ephraim Spooner, which seemed
to amuse some persons, the humor of which I never could
see.</p>

<p>But he had a nearer kinsman, his own uncle, Thomas
Spooner, who was a man of both wit and humor, from whom
he must have acquired his own delicate sense of these qualities.
Thomas Spooner was at one time town treasurer, and
many years a constable. One evening he was called upon to
serve a precept, and while making his way in the dark through
a private yard he encountered a clothes line, and then a second
one which knocked off his hat. “By George,” said he, “I
never knew before what the Bible meant by ‘precept upon
precept; line upon line.’” He was an ardent whig, and when
returning home one day after an absence of a couple of days,
he found posted on the town tree a notice for a democratic
meeting. “By thunder,” said he, “can’t I leave town twenty-four
hours without there being the devil to pay?” and he pulled
the notice down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bourne Spooner, not only as occasion offered, repeated
stories which his tenacious memory had treasured up, but he
found satire and humor in the incidents of every day life,
which he often used to point a moral, as for instance, the case
of the old lady who had a husband somewhat addicted to profanity,
and who when rebuked by a sister of the church then
attending revival meetings because she bestowed so much care
on her husband, who she said was a bad man, replied, “I know
sister, my husband is a very bad man, and has little to expect
in the next world, so I feel it my duty to do what I can for
his comfort and happiness in this.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spooner was a tender hearted man, especially towards
his workmen and their families. An instance of his tender
feelings once came under my own observation. The Cordage
Company did their banking business in Boston, discounting
once a month at the Old Colony Bank a note to obtain bills
for the monthly pay roll. During one of the financial panics
when money was almost impossible to obtain, he came one day
into the Plymouth Bank in despair. He said that he could
not get a dollar in the Old Colony Bank, and Mr. Dodd, his
Boston director, could not obtain a dollar in Boston. He had
put off the settlement of his payroll two or three times, and
he was afraid to go home and meet the disappointed looks of
his men, whose families were in absolute need of their wages.
As he said this, I noticed the tears trickling down his cheeks.
It so happened, either by good luck or good lookout, we had
for some time been confining our discounts to short paper,
and our maturities were keeping us well supplied with funds.
We gave him the money, charging him only 7 per cent, while
as the following incident will show, money was worth
more than double that rate. A day or two afterwards I met
on Water street, Boston, the President and Treasurer of a
large manufacturing concern in Taunton, who asked me if I
would let him have ten thousand dollars. I told him that I
would, and should charge him for it on a four months’ note,
fifteen per cent. He turned on his heel and left me. An hour
after I met him in the National Bank of Redemption, and he
asked me if my offer held good. I told him it did, and the
loan was made then and there.</p>

<p>Mr. Spooner married in 1813, Hannah, daughter of Amasa
and Sarah (Taylor) Bartlett, and died July 21, 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>All through my boyhood there were two brothers living on
adjoining estates on the easterly side of Court street, Leavitt
Taylor Robbins and Nathan Bacon Robbins, sons of Charles
and Mary (Bacon) Robbins. The former lived in the house
now owned by Miss Elizabeth N. Perkins from the time of his
marriage in 1831, until his death, owning a large estate of
from fifteen to twenty acres extending from Court street to the
shore. He built a wharf and established a lumber yard about
1831, which he carried on forty years or more, until his death,
and which was afterwards carried on by his son, Leavitt Taylor
Robbins, Jr., until his recent death. During that long
period it was carried on by father and son under the same
name seventy-five years, always with the highest credit and
probably longer known on the Kennebec and Penobscot than
any other lumber yard in Massachusetts. Mr. Robbins, born
in 1799, married in 1831, Lydia, daughter of Ephraim Fuller of
Kingston, and had Lydia Johnson, 1833, who married Noah P.
Burgess; Elizabeth Fuller, 1834, who married Nathaniel Morton;
Leavitt Taylor, 1837, who married Louisa A. Bradford,
and Mrs. Anna V. (Wright) Southgate, Lemuel Fuller, 1839,
Helen F., who married Edward G. Hedge, and Sarah B., and
died September 24, 1871. Nathan Bacon Robbins owned and
occupied the house now owned and occupied by Mrs. Frederick
N. Knapp, and was a shipmaster by profession, sailing
I believe, chiefly in the employ of John and James N. Sever
of Kingston. One of the ships commanded by him was the
Brookline. Born in 1797, he married in 1819, Lucia W.,
daughter of George Rider, and second in 1830, Lucia Ripley,
of Kingston, and died December 24, 1865.</p>

<p>I trust that I may be pardoned if I speak of my brother,
Charles G. Davis, of whose early life, though only two years
have elapsed since his death, most of my readers know little
or nothing. The son of William Davis, Jr., and Joanna
(White) Davis, he was born May 30, 1820, in the house now
known as the Plymouth Rock House on Cole’s Hill. After
receiving a common school education in Plymouth, he was
fitted for college, under the direction of Hon. John A. Shaw
of Bridgewater, and graduated at Harvard in 1840. He
studied law in the office of Jacob H. Loud of Plymouth, at
the Harvard Law school, and in the office of Hubbard and
Watts in Boston, and was admitted to the bar in Plymouth
at the August term of the Common Pleas Court in 1842, establishing
himself in practice in Boston, where he remained
until 1853. During his nine years residence in Boston, he was
at various times in partnership with William H. Whitman,
George P. Sanger and Seth Webb. In 1848 he was one of the
prominent organizers of the Free Soil Party, and was a delegate
to the Buffalo Convention, which nominated Martin Van
Buren for President, and Charles Francis Adams for Vice
President.</p>

<p>In 1851 he was tried before Benjamin F. Hallet, U. S. Commissioner,
for complicity in the rescue of Shadrach, a fugitive
slave. The charge was that as he was entering the court
room, Shadrach was going out, and that he held the door in
such a way as to make the escape effectual. Though he was
acquitted, I never knew how much or how little, if at all, he
aided the negro in his flight. In 1853 Mr. Davis was a member
of the state constitutional convention, and in that year
changed his residence to Plymouth, and building a house, established
there his permanent home. In 1856 he was appointed
a member of the State Board of Agriculture, and in the
same year chosen President of the Plymouth County Agricultural
Society, retaining the latter office until 1876. In 1859
he was chosen an overseer of Harvard University. In 1861<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
he was appointed by Gov. Andrew on a commission to propose
a plan for a State Agricultural College, and after the establishment
of that institution, served as one of its trustees many
years. In 1862 he represented his town in the General Court,
and in the same year was appointed under the U. S. Revenue
law assessor for the first District, holding that office until
1869. In 1874 he was appointed Judge of the 3d District
Court, and remained on the bench until his death. He loved
his native town, and was always recognized as a public spirited
man, who would make a liberal response to every call aiming
at its welfare. He built Davis building in 1854, the brick
block at the corner of Railroad avenue in 1870, and was for
many years the largest individual holder of real estate in the
town. He married November 19, 1845, Hannah Stevenson,
daughter of Col. John B. Thomas and Mary (LeBaron)
Thomas, and has two children living, Joanna, wife of Richard
H. Morgan, and Charles S. Davis, a graduate at Harvard in
1880, and now practicing law in Plymouth.</p>

<p>As thirty-seven years have elapsed since the death of Robert
B. Hall, I am inclined to think that three-quarters of my
readers know no more concerning him than that his widow
was until her recent death a much respected resident in Plymouth.
Mr. Hall was the son of Charles and Catherine Hall,
and was born in Boston, January 12, 1812. He had not as far
as I know a collegiate education, but prepared for the Congregational
ministry at the Yale Divinity school. After leaving
the school he spent two years in Europe, where he gratified
his taste not only by literary pursuits, but also by the
study of art in its various forms. He served also during his
absence as an agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society.
In 1837, soon after his return, he was settled over the Third
Society in Plymouth, whose place of worship was on Pleasant
street, opposite Training Green. In that year he delivered an
address before the Pilgrim Society on the anniversary of the
Landing of the Pilgrims, and in 1839 on the same occasion an
address before the Third church. In 1841 he delivered an address
at the dedication of Oak Grove cemetery.</p>

<p>In 1840, largely through his influence, the present church
on the north side of Town Square was built under the name
of the Church of the Pilgrimage, and a new society was
formed called the Society of the Pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>In 1844 Mr. Hall became Episcopalian in faith, and at his
house on the 15th of November in that year, the present Episcopal
Society was formed, and on the 3d of October, 1846, the
church on Russell street was consecrated with Theodore W.
Snow, rector, who had been chosen on the 13th of the previous
April. At about that time Mr. Hall was called to St.
James’ Episcopal church in Roxbury, where he remained several
years. In 1849 he returned to Plymouth, where he
preached for a time in the Robinson church, and soon after
built the house on the corner of Lothrop Place, which he made
his home until his death. In 1855 he joined the Know Nothing
movement, and was chosen State Senator, and in 1856 he
was chosen by the Know Nothings, member of Congress.
In 1858 on the termination of the Know Nothing party, he
was sent back to Congress by the Republicans, thus serving
two terms in Washington. After his retirement from public
life he devoted himself to literary pursuits, and in 1864 delivered
the oration at the dedication of the Masonic building
in Boston on the corner of Tremont and Boylston streets.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall married in 1841 Abby Mitchell, daughter of Nathaniel
Morton Davis, and died April 15, 1868.</p>

<p>I suppose that few of my readers know that Jonathan Walker,
the man with the branded hand, ever lived in Plymouth.
About fifty years ago, or perhaps a little earlier, he lived in the
house now standing in what is called the Nook at the head
waters of Hobb’s Hole brook. I do not remember to have
ever seen him, but I recall the time when he was complained
of for shingling his house on the Sabbath. He was born in
Harvard, Mass., March 22, 1799, and at the age of seventeen
went to sea. When quite young he assisted Benjamin Lundy
in colonizing slaves in Mexico, and for a time lived with his
family in Florida. In 1844 he assisted four slaves to escape
by water, but was overtaken and captured with his companions
by a Revenue Cutter, which was sent in pursuit. He was carried
to Pensacola, and after trial for his offense was sentenced
to stand one hour in the pillory, to pay a fine of one hundred
and fifty dollars, and be branded on the hand with the letters
S. S., signifying slave stealer. It is creditable to Southern
humanity that a blacksmith refused to heat the instrument of
torture. He remained in prison eleven months in default of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
payment of the fine, and was then by the aid of Northern
friends released. After his release he delivered lectures in
various Northern towns, and then settled down in Plymouth.
In 1863 he bought a farm in Lake Harbor, Michigan, and
carried on the business of raising fruit until his death, April
30, 1875. He left behind him in Plymouth a son John, whom
I knew very well, and whom it fell to me once to aid during
a pecuniary embarrassment. His father had neglected his
education, but he was a noble fellow in whose presence I always
felt that I was in the presence of a man.</p>

<p>I think he was one of not more than twenty men whose personality
during my long life has impressed me. He always
called me William, and I always called him John. I would
have trusted to him my life in any emergency, for I knew
that he would have risked his own to save the life of a fellow
man. He held a commission as pilot for some years, and in
appearance an ideal pilot he was. With his broad Scotch face,
almost buried in hair and whiskers, it was easy to imagine
him in his tarpaulin and oil clothes beating his pilot lugger
up channel in a heavy sea. About eight years ago he went to
Michigan to live with a sister on a farm which his father had
occupied, and a few months ago I heard of his death.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Joseph Bartlett, who lived on the corner
of Court street and Court square, but there was another
Joseph Bartlett of whom probably few of my readers have
ever heard. He was a man of diversified talents, of diversified
traits of character, and led a diversified life. He was
author, poet, orator, lecturer, lawyer, merchant, gambler, prisoner
for debt, and generally an adventurer. He was son of
Sylvanus and Martha (Wait) Bartlett, and was born in Plymouth
in 1761. His father was a well to do merchant, who
owned real estate in the neighborhood of the present junction
of High and Russell streets. He had a sister, Sophia, who
married Benjamin Drew, the father of our late deceased friend,
Benjamin Drew, and I have always supposed that our friend
inherited his brilliant talents from his mother’s side of the
house. Mr. Bartlett graduated at Harvard in 1782, and
studied law in Salem, and was recommended to be sworn as
attorney in 1788. Soon after the close of the revolution he
went to England, and in London, attracted by his eccentricities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
and wit much attention. One evening at the theatre
during the performance of a play in which American soldiers
were caricatured as cobblers, tailors and tinkers, he stood up
in the pit and called for cheers for the army of cobblers, tailors
and tinkers who had defeated the British. The interference
so far from being resented, was taken in good part, and the
young Londoners took him into their companionship and invited
him to the clubs where he was for a time made much of.
He afterwards fell into gambling habits, and finally was imprisoned
for debt. He wrote a play, and from the proceeds
of its sale obtained a release, after which for a short time he
appeared on the stage. After his return home he opened a
law office in Woburn, and painted it black, calling it “the
coffin” to attract notice. He afterwards removed to Cambridge,
and in 1799 delivered a poem before the Harvard Phi
Beta Kappa Society on “Physiognomy,” in which some of his
allusions, like the following, were believed to be personal:</p>

<p>In 1823 he delivered a Fourth of July oration in Boston,
and recited a poem entitled, “The New Vicar of Bray.” At
one time in his varied career he was a member of the Maine
legislature, and at another had a law office in Portsmouth, N.
H. In 1823 he published a collection of “Aphorisms on men,
manners, principles and things,” and also an essay on “The
blessings of poverty,” prefaced by the following lines:</p>

<p>I have two letters from Mr. Bartlett to my grandfather,
William Davis, soliciting aid, and one to my grandfather from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
President Kirkland of Harvard University, inclosing thirteen
dollars contributed by a few Cambridge gentlemen with the
request that he would use it for Mr. Bartlett’s benefit. He
married Anna May, daughter of Thomas Witherell of Plymouth,
and died in Boston, October 21, 1827.</p>

<p>Of Perez Morton, a Plymouth man, and one of the most
distinguished members of the Massachusetts bar in the latter
part of the eighteenth century, and the first half of the nineteenth,
probably few of my Plymouth readers have ever
heard. He was son of Joseph and Amiah (Bullock) Morton
of Plymouth, and was born October 22, 1750. He graduated
at Harvard in 1771, and was recommended to be sworn as
attorney in 1774. In 1786 he was made a Barrister, and on
the 7th of September, 1810, he was appointed Attorney
General. At the time of the appointment of Mr. Morton
as Attorney General, the office of Solicitor General
was occupied by Daniel Davis, who had been appointed
January 20, 1802, under an act passed March 4,
1800, reviving the office which had been discontinued for a
time after the revolution. In 1821 it having been the general
feeling for some time that the two offices were unnecessary,
the legislature, while unwilling on account of the respect entertained
for their incumbents, to abolish either, passed an act
providing “that whenever the office of Attorney General or
Solicitor General shall become vacant by death, resignation or
otherwise, the salary annexed to the office, which shall first
so become vacant as aforesaid, shall thenceforth cease and determine.”
As neither death nor resignation occurred, an act
was passed March 14, 1832, to take effect June 1, abolishing
both offices and establishing the office of Attorney General
for the Commonwealth. On the 31st of May, therefore, 1832,
Mr. Morton went out of office, and James T. Austin was appointed
under the new law, Attorney General of the Commonwealth.
Sarah Morton, the wife of Perez, was an authoress
of some repute. She wrote a book entitled, “The power
of Sympathy,” a copy of which is in the library of the Pilgrim
Society, which is claimed to have been the first American
novel. Mr. Morton died in Boston, October 14, 1837.</p>

<p>I cannot pass by Court Square without a notice of Mrs.
Nicolson’s boarding house, which stood many years on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
north side of the Square. Thomas Nicholson, son of James,
came into possession of the house after the death of his father
in 1772. He married for a second wife about 1790, Hannah,
daughter of John Otis, and sister of Mrs. Grace Heyman Goddard,
already noticed as the mother of Mrs. Abraham Jackson.
Thomas Nicolson was a shipmaster, and I believe was
for some time before his death in the United States Revenue
Service, and died on the island of Gaudaloupe, February 9,
1798.</p>

<p>He was also during the revolution commander of the privateer
sloop America, carrying six swivels and seventy men,
owned by William Watson, Ephraim Spooner and others.
Capt. Nicolson had by his first wife Sarah Mayhew, nine
children: Sarah, 1771; Hannah, 1773; Polly, 1775; Elizabeth,
1777; Lucy Mayhew, 1778; Nancy, 1780; Thomas, 1782;
James, 1784, and Anna. Of these Hannah married John
Morong; Polly married John Allen of Salem, and Anna married
John D. Wilson of Salem. Lucy Mayhew died in Boston,
January 21, 1858. By his second wife, Hannah Otis, he had
Samuel, 1791, who married Sarah Brinley, and died in Boston,
January 6, 1866; Hannah Otis, 1793, who married William
Spooner; Daniel, 1796, who died March 6, 1815; Caroline,
1798, who married Edward Miller of Quincy.</p>

<p>The estate when Capt. Nicolson died extended from the
present yard of Mr. Hedge to the line of Mr. Bittinger, and
consisted of the main house and a range of outbuildings
which included a woodshed, chaise house, ice house and barn,
with a large garden in the rear. After Capt. Nicolson’s death,
but precisely when I do not know, Mrs. Nicolson fitted up her
house as an inn, and called it the Old Colony House. The
Pilgrim House was the stage house, and Mrs. Nicolson’s
house was the lawyer’s house. The judges, however, sought
private lodgings, and I remember that Chief Justice Shaw always
occupied a front parlor in the house opposite Court
square, which was the residence of Ichabod Shaw, where the
Methodist church now stands. Among the regular boarders
in the Old Colony House whom I remember were Samuel
Davis, Ebenezer G. Parker, cashier of the Old Colony Bank,
Gustavus Gilbert, attorney, Eliab Ward, student at law, Isaac
N. Stoddard and Hiram Fuller, teachers. During the sessions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
of the court it was the gathering place of the lawyers who,
without railroad conveniences, made a week of it under Mrs.
Nicolson’s roof. There might be found Charles J. Holmes of
Rochester, Seth Miller of Wareham, Zachariah Eddy of Middleboro,
Williams Latham of Bridgewater, William Baylies and
Austin Packard of West Bridgewater, Welcome Young of
East Bridgewater, Kilborn Whitman of Pembroke, and Ebenezer
Gay of Hingham. To these were sometimes added
James T. Austin, Attorney General, Franklin Dexter and
Rufus Choate. Timothy Coffin of New Bedford generally attended
the Plymouth court, and was sought for in many cases
on one side or the other to make the argument to the jury.
If he could find anybody to play a game of cards he would
play nearly all night, and come into court in the morning looking
as fresh as a rose. The house was a rambling one with
sleeping rooms arranged in such a way that it was difficult
to find them. There was one in particular through which it
was necessary for the occupants of the other rooms to pass.
This room was assigned on one occasion to Mr. Choate, whose
habit it was to retire early. In the morning when he appeared
at the breakfast table and was asked how he had slept, he answered,
“Very well, I thank you, considering I slept in the
highway.” As the lawyers sat by the fire in the evening, Mr.
Eddy in a dressing gown, and Mr. Latham securing a seat
near the spittoon, occasionally some one would say, “Packard,
are we there?” To understand this question, a story must be
told. In the early days of the Old Colony Railroad, just after
what was called the Abington branch was built, the lawyers I
have named met at Bridgewater to take the train for Abington
to meet the last train to Plymouth to attend the usual session
of the court. When the branch train reached East Bridgewater,
Packard, who thought he knew all about the road,
jumped up and said, “Warl guntlemen, here we ar,” and they
all got out to find the train going on, and themselves in a
dreary station, on a cold and dark November night, seventeen
miles from Plymouth. There was only one thing to do, to hire
an omnibus, which they promptly did, and they reached their
destination about half past ten, cold, hungry and cross.
Hence the inquiry, “Packard, are we there?” All the gentlemen
named are dead, and were doubtless met by Packard on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the further shore with “Warl gentlemen, here we ar.” I hope
he has not landed them at the wrong station.</p>

<p>In 1836 Mrs. Nicolson gave up the public house, and moved
to Boston to live with her daughter, Mrs. Miller, and died in
that city, June 22, 1844. The Old Colony House was kept
afterwards by Zaben Olney and William Randall, and after a
further occupation as a private residence by Moses Bates and
Theodore Drew, was sold in 1835 to Mary Howard Russell
and taken down.</p>

<p>On the south side of Court square on the corner of School
street, there lived until 1839 a worthy old man, who for some
years was stone blind. He was Joseph Barnes, the great-grandfather
of our townsman, bearing the same name. He
carried, extended out in front of him, a staff about eight feet
long, with which he tapped the sidewalk constantly, and directed
his steps without any other guide or support. It was
his privilege to live in days when bicycles, automobiles and
trolley cars had not been invented to endanger the lives of
even the far-seeing and wary. As I remember him he walked
alone through the various streets of the town, and if occasional
aid became necessary in avoiding some new obstruction,
both old and young were ready to lend it. His wife kept a
little candy shop, if so it may be called, in the front room on
the east side of the front door, and there children who thought
it too far to go to Nancy and Eliza’s shop on Market street,
patronized her. It was a queer kind of a shop, showing as
its only furniture a bed and chairs, and looking glass and
table. Under the bed three or four spice boxes were placed
in a row, containing in tempting neatness assortments of
candy comprising the usual twisted parti-colored sticks, and
kisses and Salem Gibraltars. How these last received their
name, and why their manufacture should have been confined
to Salem, I never knew, but there they were made, and there
they are made today, and if any of my young readers never
saw them, they had better induce their grocer to send for some
and keep them in stock. Their makers are welcome to this
gratuitous advertisement. Mr. Barnes died January 28, 1839,
and the house in which he lived was occupied some years
by Nathaniel Cobb Lanman, and finally removed to Lothrop
street, when Court square was widened in 1857.</p>

</div>


<p>Through all my boyhood Nathaniel Morton Davis occupied
the house on Court street, now owned by the Old Colony
Club, except for a year, when, while repairing the house, he
occupied for a year or more the house on Leyden street, which
his mother had occupied before her removal to Boston. The
house at that time had its front door on the southerly side
where an arch may now be seen in the front hall. On the west
side of the front door there was a good sized parlor, which
reached within about three feet of the street. What is now
the library, lapped far enough by the above parlor to admit
of a door from one to the other, and was the law office of Mr.
Davis, with an outside entrance north of the parlor above
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was the son of William and Rebecca Morton
Davis, and was born in Plymouth March 3, 1785. He graduated
at Harvard in 1804, and after studying law with Judge
Joshua Thomas, was admitted to the bar in Plymouth. He
was appointed early in his career Judge Advocate, with the
rank of Major, which title he bore through life. In 1821 he
was appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Sessions, and
served until the court was abolished in 1828. He was at various
times representative and senator, and was a member of
the executive council from 1841 to 1843. He was a director
of the Plymouth Bank from 1826 to 1839, and from 1840 to
1848, and President from 1840 until his death. He was a
man of commanding presence, an impressive speaker, and was
selected on several public occasions to act as presiding officer.
The first time I saw him in the President’s chair was at a
whig county celebration on the Fourth of July, 1840, when
the chief address of the day was made by Robert C. Winthrop.
His speech and his toasts calling up the speakers were unusually
happy. Martin Van Buren, who had succeeded Andrew
Jackson as President, and was a candidate for re-election,
had many times boasted of following in the footsteps of
his illustrious predecessor, and Mr. Davis gave as one of the
sentiments, “Martin Van Buren, he has followed so fast in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
footsteps of his illustrious predecessor, that he has accomplished
his journey in half the time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis married, July 8, 1817, Harriet Lazell, daughter
of Judge Nahum Mitchell of East Bridgewater, and his children
were William, born May 12, 1818, who married December
2, 1849, Helen, daughter of John Russell; Abby Mitchell,
born November 9, 1821, who married in 1841 Robert B. Hall,
and Elizabeth Bliss, born November 8, 1824, who married
Henry G. Andrews. Mr. Davis died at the United States
Hotel in Boston, July 29, 1848.</p>

<p>In 1849, William Davis, previous to his marriage, cut off
the westerly end of the house in question, and it was moved to
a lot on Court street, opposite the foot of Cushman street,
where it now stands the property of Charles B. Bartlett. I
have never known a more complete mutilation of a house than
that caused by the alteration to which I have referred.</p>

<p>Before leaving Mr. Davis I must tell a story about his dog
Ponto, which illustrates the intelligence often found in the
canine race. He was an ordinary black and white cur, which,
as is often the case with favorite dogs, was equally a delight
to his master, and a nuisance to everybody else. He was in
the habit of following the family to church, and after being
kicked out by the sexton, he would slyly find his way in, and
going up the broad aisle, scratch at the family pew door. In
order to stop this habit, orders were given to keep him confined
to the house on Sundays, to which Ponto demurred.
After suffering confinement two Sundays he circumvented the
orders and through the first door or window which happened
to be opened, every Sunday morning at the earliest opportunity
he left the house and fled to the house of Nathaniel
Holmes, on School street, who did the family chores, and
there passed the day, returning home in the evening. He
knew when Sunday came by symptoms, which he easily discovered,
and while never going to the Holmes house at any
other time, he kept up his weekly visits for many months, until
sickness or accident ended his career.</p>

<p>Ponto reminds me of another dog which belonged to John
J. Russell, when he lived in the Cotton house, which stood
where Brewster street enters Court street. Mr. Russell bought
of Warren Douglas of Half Way Pond one of a litter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
hound pups with the agreement to take him when he became
old enough to be of use. When he thought it about time to
bring him home he went for him, and it being a rainy day he
held the pup by a chain between his feet beneath the boot
which excluded all sight of the road over which he had never
before travelled. At the end of a fortnight, thinking that
the pup had been chained to his kennel long enough to become
domesticated, he unfastened his chain with the intention of
giving him his breakfast. Preferring, however, freedom to
breakfast, the pup hopped over the fence, and was last seen
running up Court square. Mr. Russell, thinking he might
have found his way to Half Way Pond, drove there the next
day, and there was the pup. On comparing notes with Mr.
Douglas, it was found that the little fellow had travelled ten
miles in less than two hours. So much for the instinct of
Ponto and the hound pup. If we ask what instinct is, it might
be correct to say that it is the gift of God unimpaired by education.
The homing pigeon has it when she finds her way to
her distant nest. The Indian has it somewhat qualified by
civilization when he laughs at the white man who needs a
watch to show the lapse of time. The Christian has it, beyond
the realm of reason, a divine teacher assuring
him of a life beyond the grave, a belief in which the device
of human education has done much to impair if not destroy.
But without further suggestion I submit these mysteries to
the investigation of my readers and pass on.</p>

<p>The Old Plymouth Bank building stood until recently where
the Russell building now stands. It was bought by the bank
at the time of its incorporation in 1803, and a brick addition
was erected at its southerly end for the accommodation of the
bank. William Goodwin, who had served as cashier from the
foundation of the bank, died July 17, 1825, and Nathaniel
Goodwin was chosen to succeed him. He moved at once into
the bank house, and continued to occupy it until his resignation
as cashier in 1845, when he moved into the house on the
corner of Middle and Carver streets, where he died February
13, 1857. In early life he carried on the manufacture of rope
in Nantucket, and later in Beverly. He was the son of General
Nathaniel Goodwin, and was born in 1770 in the house
on Leyden street, owned and occupied by his father, and afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
long kept as a hotel by John Howland Bradford, and
known as Bradford’s tavern. He married in 1794 Lydia,
daughter of Nathaniel Gardner of Nantucket, and had seven
children, only four of whom I remember, Lydia Coffin, 1800,
who married Thomas Hedge; Albert Gardner, 1802, who married
1831 Eliza Huzzey of Nantucket, and 1840 Eliza Ann,
daughter of Joseph Bartlett, and Nathaniel, 1809, who married,
1833, Arabella, daughter of William White of New Bedford.
Mr. Goodwin was the last person in Plymouth to wear
a cue. Mrs. Goodwin was a quakeress, always wearing the
garb of her faith, which was further illustrated by her gentle
spirit and kindly words.</p>

<p>That part of the house used for a dwelling was occupied
at various times after Mr. Goodwin moved to Middle
street by Samuel Lanman, George F. Andrews, and Frank
A. Johnson, the last of whom kept a public house under the
name of the Winslow House. The old banking room was
used by Daniel J. Jane and Samuel Merriam, shoe manufacturers;
Charles F. Hathaway, for a general store; Joseph P.
Brown, cabinet maker, and Frank A. Johnson in connection
with his hotel. It is only necessary to say further in connection
with the old bank building that it was taken down
and the Russell building erected on its site in 1892.</p>

<p>Daniel J. Lane manufactured one hundred thousand pairs
of boots and shoes annually, and gave employment to about
one hundred and sixty hands. There were other manufacturers
of shoes about the same time, of whom it will be well
to speak: S. Blake &amp; Co., who made one hundred and twenty
thousand pairs, employing about two hundred hands, having
their headquarters in Leyden hall building; John Churchill,
Benjamin Bramhall, William Morey, Henry Mills and Nathaniel
Cobb Lanman, in whose shop on Allerton street William
L. Douglas was a workman.</p>

<p>George Gustavus Dyer came to Plymouth with Mr. Blake
from Abington, and after serving as bookkeeper for his company,
was elected cashier of the Old Colony Bank. Mr. Dyer
was the son of Christopher and Mary (Porter) Dyer of
Abington, and married in 1852 Mary Ann Bartlett, daughter
of Schuyler Sampson. After some years’ service as cashier of
the Old Colony Bank, he was chosen President, and died
January 9, 1891.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>The shoe business in the days to which I have referred was
conducted very differently from the methods in vogue today.
The headquarters not necessarily extensive, were used for the
reception of stock, the cutting of the leather, the shipment of
shoes and the business office. When the leather was cut shoemakers
would call periodically for packages of uppers, and
linings and heels, and making the shoes at home would bring
them to the office and carry home a new supply. They would
furnish their own tools and thread and nails and pegs, and
consequently the need existed of local stores, such as that
which was kept on Main street by Harrison Finney for shoe
kit and findings. These shoemakers did their work at home,
and there was scarcely a house in the smaller towns which
did not have its small shop on the premises where the cut material
was converted into shoes for the more or less distant
manufacturer. In consequence of the change above mentioned,
the local kit stores were abandoned, and there was a
gradual flow of population from the farming towns where the
little workshops were located to the large towns, Abington,
Brockton, Rockland, Plymouth and Whitman, where the factories
were built. This is one of the causes of the falling off
of population in the smaller towns, and of the rapid growth
of the larger ones. There are indications now of a reflex tide,
as a result of the facilities afforded by trolley cars for workmen
to seek distant homes where the cost of living is moderate,
and where in dull seasons farming can be carried on with
profit.</p>

<p>The building which stood on the corner of Court and North
streets, which was taken down and replaced by the Howland
building in 1888, was occupied as long ago as I can remember
by Dr. Rossiter Cotton. He was the son of John and Hannah
(Sturtevant) Cotton, and was born in 1758. He married in
1783 Priscilla, daughter of Thomas Jackson, and had nine
children, of whom I only remember two, Charles, born in 1788,
and Rowland Edwin, born in 1802.</p>

<p>Dr. Cotton practiced medicine in Plymouth about twenty
years, and retired from his profession in 1807. He seems to
have inherited the right to hold county offices. His grandfather,
Josiah Cotton, was Register of Deeds and County
Treasurer from 1713 to 1756; his father, John Cotton, held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
both offices from 1756 to 1789, and he held the same offices
from 1789 to his death, August 12, 1837. His son, Rowland
Edwin, continued in the office of Register from 1837 to 1846.
Thus the office of Register was held in the family through
four generations, one hundred and thirty-three years, and the
office of Treasurer through three generations, one hundred
and twenty-four years. Dr. Cotton was an antiquarian, and I
find on the records many of his memoranda and plans, which
aid materially in elucidating matters which without them it
would have been difficult to understand. His son, Charles
Cotton, graduated at Harvard in 1808, and settled as a physician
in Newport, where he married a Miss Northam, and
had a family of children, of whom I only remember four, Rossiter,
Thomas, Charles and Sophia. He removed to Plymouth
in 1831, occupying the house under consideration, where he
practised until his father’s death in 1837, when he returned
to Newport, where he died. The three boys attended the
high school with me, and must have been all within two years
of my age. I remember two incidents of our school days, with
which they are associated. I have referred in a former chapter
to the rule, while Mr. William H. Lord was the teacher,
for each boy to repeat at the opening of the school in the
morning a verse from the bible. One day Rossiter received a
flogging for some offense, and the next morning he repeated
in his turn, “For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.” The
other incident occurred while Mr. Isaac N. Stoddard was
teacher. Dr. Cotton thought his son Charles had been either
unjustly or too severely whipped, so arming himself with a
whip he went to Mrs. Nicolson’s hotel where Mr. Stoddard
boarded, with the intention of flogging him. But he reckoned
without his host, and when he raised his whip, Mr. Stoddard,
seizing him by the collar, laid him on the floor, and taking his
whip away sent him home.</p>

<p>In 1833 scarlet fever prevailed extensively in Plymouth,
and was very fatal. In a population of 5,000 the number of
deaths during the year was one hundred and sixty-seven, of
which sixty-seven were of children under ten years of age.
Taking the population of Plymouth in 1904 of 11,118, and
the number of deaths in that year, one hundred and fifty-seven,
as a basis, the normal number of deaths in the population of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
five thousand in 1833, would have been less than seventy. I
remember that a daughter of Dr. Charles Cotton, either Sophia
or another whose name I do not recall, died of the prevailing
disease, and that I was one of the pall bearers at her
funeral. It was the invariable custom in those days, never
varied from, to have pall bearers for old and young, and in
cases of funerals of children, Clement Bates, the sexton,
would call at the High school and ask for a detail of six boys
for service at one or more of the funerals on that day. As
well as I can remember, no precautions were taken to prevent
the spread of the contagion, and funerals were attended as
usual, and no quarantine was established. I have no doubt
that during the visitation of the sickness I served as pall
bearer at least a dozen times.</p>

<p>Some years later I narrowly escaped serious inconvenience
arising from municipal precautions against contagious diseases.
In February, 1857, I had a schooner in the West India trade,
and when after her departure from Boston in the early part
of that month I thought her well on her way towards her destination,
I received a telegram from Thomas Everett Cornish,
her master, that she had been caught by the ice in the bay soon
after leaving Boston, and driven by the prevailing northwest
gales into Truro Bay, where she was in the ice jam a week,
during which she had received damages which she was now
repairing in Provincetown. I at once drove to Sandwich, and
taking the cars for Yarmouth, then the terminus of the Cape
Cod Railroad, drove to Truro, reaching there about midnight.
The next morning I hired a conveyance to Provincetown,
reaching there for dinner. After dinner I boarded the schooner,
where carpenters were at work getting out new stanchions
for the damaged bulwarks. While talking in the cabin with
Capt. Cornish, who was bald, and had taken off his hat, I
noticed some pustules on his scalp which I saw at once were
the pustules of varioloid. Fearing that he might become sick
and would require a substitute for the voyage, I called on
Dr. Stone, who fortunately was an old friend, and took him
to see the Captain, whom he at once declared suffering from
a mild attack of varioloid, which, however, would not prevent
his prosecution of the voyage. He said that he was the port
physician, and that it would be his duty to report the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
to the board of health. Fortunately I had said nothing at the
hotel concerning my business, or my connection with the
schooner, and I exacted a promise from Dr. Stone to say nothing
about me. Not long after the departure of the Doctor
we heard while sitting in the cabin a hail from the head of
the wharf commanding the captain to haul at once into the
stream and have no communication with the shore. A watchman
was placed at the head of the wharf by the board of
health, and I began to wonder how I was to escape a quarantine.
I waited until after dark and then giving the captain
directions to proceed to Boston with the first favorable wind,
I went ashore, and sneaking up behind a store house with
only the cap log of the wharf to walk on, I found an opening
between two buildings about four feet wide, and came out on
the street unobserved. As I walked to the hotel I found the
town in a panic, and groups were standing here and there discussing
the situation. I spoke to no one but on reaching the
hotel gave orders to be called to take the six o’clock mail
chaise, and went to bed. At six o’clock I was off and reached
home the same day. It was eight days before my vessel was
able to reach Boston, and thus I narrowly escaped a prolonged
confinement on board, and the watchfulness of the Provincetown
board of health. In view of my experience I advise
my readers in visiting a town, to follow my example, and say
nothing and keep open the avenues of retreat.</p>

<p>After the death of Dr. Rossiter Cotton in 1837, and the
return of his son to Newport, the house in question was kept
as a hotel named the Mansion House for some years by James
G. Gleason, succeeded by Benjamin H. Crandon and N. M.
Perry. In still later years the post office occupied the corner
room down stairs for a time, and the Custom House a room
upstairs, until finally the whole upper part of the building and
the northerly and easterly part below were occupied by newspaper
offices, and the corner by Charles P. Morse for a drug
store, until the building was taken down in 1888. Since the
mention of N. M. Perry in a previous chapter, I have learned
that he was a native of Holliston.</p>

<p>There are several estates on the west side of Court street,
whose occupants have not been noticed. Opposite the head
of North street there was in my youth the Lothrop estate, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
which a house stood, which was occupied by Dr. Nathaniel
Lothrop, until his death, October 10, 1828. Dr. Lothrop was
the son of Isaac and Priscilla (Thomas) (Watson) Lothrop,
and was born in the house in question in 1737. His mother
married in 1758, Noah Hobart of Fairfield, Connecticut, who
had a daughter Ellen by a previous wife. This daughter,
Ellen Hobart, married Nathaniel Lothrop, and thus Nathaniel
Lothrop married his mother’s step-daughter, and Ellen Hobart
married her father’s step-son. I leave my readers to determine
the relationship between them. In 1831 the Lothrop
house was taken down, and while its demolition was going
on, I a boy of nine years of age, saw quantities of papers
thrown out of the garret windows, and picking up many of
them carried them home. I found them on examination to be
official papers with autographs bearing date from 1675 to 1700.
These I arranged in an album, and have recently presented
them to the Pilgrim Society. In 1832 the northerly part of
the lot was sold to Jacob H. Loud, who built the house now
owned and occupied by Mrs. Francis B. Davis.</p>

<p>The southerly part of the lot was sold in 1839 to Nathaniel
Russell, Jr., who built the house now occupied by Col. William
P. Stoddard, and occupied it until his father’s death in
1852, when he moved into the brick house on the corner of
Court Square, which had been his father’s home. At his
removal the house was left furnished, and was occupied during
the summer of 1853 by Richard Warren and family of New
York. From the autumn of 1853 to the autumn of 1854, the
house was occupied by myself, and there in the summer of
1854 my oldest child was born. Not long after I left the
house, it was occupied by Rev. George S. Ball, during his pastorate
as colleague of Rev. Dr. Kendall. In 1857 the house
was sold to Jeremiah Farris, whose son-in-law, Col. Stoddard,
now occupies it.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell was as has been before stated, the son of Nathaniel
and Martha (LeBaron) Russell, and was born in
Bridgewater, December 18, 1801. He graduated at Harvard
in 1820, and married, June 25, 1827, Catherine Elizabeth,
daughter of Daniel Robert and Betsey Hayward (Thacher)
Elliott of Savannah, Georgia, and died February 16, 1875.
Until 1837 he was associated with his father in the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of the iron industries belonging to the firm of N. Russell
&amp; Co., composed of Nathaniel Russell, William Davis and
Barnabas Hedge. After the retirement of the Davis and
Hedge interests from the firm, Mr. Russell became a member
of the firm of N. Russell &amp; Co., and so continued until the
death of his father, October 21, 1852, after which he continued
the business until the sale of the Summer street works in 1866
to the Robinson Iron Co.</p>

<p>During the exciting period of anti-masonry which extended
from 1828 to 1835, an anti-masonic political party sprang up
in many of the Northern states, and candidates were generally
nominated for State and National offices. The party had
its origin in the belief that William Morgan of Batavia, New
York, a former mason, who was reported to intend publishing
the secrets of the order of free masons, had been kidnapped
and drowned in Lake Ontario. It was believed that the masonic
oath disqualified those in the higher degrees from serving
as jurors in cases where members of the same degrees
were parties. The anti-masonic party originated in New York
in 1828, and in 1830 Francis Granger, its candidate for Governor,
received 128,000 votes. In 1831 a National Anti-masonic
convention nominated William Wirt of Maryland, and
Amos Ellmaker of Pennsylvania, for President and Vice-President.
Vermont was the only state which threw its electoral
vote for the anti-masonic candidates. The anti-masonic
excitement reached Plymouth, and for one or more years Mr.
Russell was chosen a member of the legislature on the anti-masonic
ticket. I am not a mason, but as a somewhat close
observer of public affairs for nearly seventy years, and many
times a successful candidate for public office, I feel bound to
say that I have never suspected any masonic participation
either collectively or individually in the selection of nominees
to office, or the election of candidates.</p>

<p>In 1840 after the death of Barnabas Hedge, Mr. Russell was
chosen to succeed him as President of the Plymouth Institution
for Savings, which was incorporated in 1828, and continued
in office until his death. In 1847, during his incumbency,
the name of the institution was changed to the Plymouth
Savings Bank.</p>

<p>The house in North street occupied by Dr. Brown, stands on
the site of a house, which in my youth, was owned and occupied
by Stephen Marcy. The old house was during the revolution
kept as an Inn by Thomas Southworth Howland, and
there on December 22, 1769, the Old Colony Club for the first
time celebrated the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims.
On that occasion at half-past two a dinner composed of the
following dishes was served: “A large baked Indian whortleberry
pudding, a dish of sauquetach, a dish of clams, a dish of
oysters, and a dish of cod fish, a haunch of venison, a dish of
sea fowl, a dish of frost fish and eels, an apple pie, a course of
cranberry tarts and cheese.”</p>

<p>The pudding alone preceded the meat, and the dessert was
as now the last course. This custom went out before my day,
but it was no more strange than that now in vogue, of beginning
a breakfast with fruit and oatmeal.</p>

<p>I remember the house well with a front door near its westerly
end, and an office door near its easterly end opening into
a room which in its last days was occupied by Dr. Robert
Capen. In 1833 Jacob Covington bought the estate and built
the house now standing.</p>

<p>The Covington family was not one of the old Plymouth
families. Thomas Covington came to Plymouth a few years
before the revolution, and married in 1771 Sarah, daughter of
Joseph Tribble. Jacob Covington, son of Thomas, was no
doubt a shipmaster in early life. He was evidently trained in
a business school, and was repeatedly placed in positions of
trust by his fellow-citizens. He was the first President of the
Old Colony Insurance Company, and of the Old Colony Bank,
holding both positions until his death. He was among the
first to enter the business of the whale fishery, and was among
its most energetic and competent managers. The enterprise
of building Long Wharf, and putting the steamboat General
Lafayette on the line between Plymouth and Boston, was
chiefly due to him and James Bartlett. He married in 1816,
Patty, daughter of Gideon Holbrook, and had Elam, 1817,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
who died in California; Mary Holbrook, 1820, who died in
East Orange; Martha Ann, 1822, who died in Plymouth; Edwin,
1825, who died in Boston; Harriet, 1827, who died in
Plymouth; Helen, 1830, still living; Jacob, 1832, who died in
Providence, and Leonard, 1834, who died in Dorchester.</p>

<p>Mary Holbrook Covington married George H. Bates, a native
of Farmington, Maine, and the wife of Rev. Dr. Mann,
the present rector of Trinity church in Boston, is her granddaughter.
Capt. Covington died May 28, 1835, at the age of
forty-four. After the death of Capt. Covington the house in
question came into the occupancy of Josiah Robbins, who has
already been noticed, and later of Thomas Prince, who occupied
it as a boarding house. The next occupant was Peter
Holmes, who was the son of Peter and Sally (Harlow)
Holmes, and was born in 1804. Mr. Holmes was engaged
many years in Boston in the cork manufacture, returning to
Plymouth and becoming the owner of the house under consideration.
He died October 14, 1880, and the house came
into the possession of Nathaniel Morton in 1881, who owned
and occupied it until Dr. W. G. Brown not many years since
came into its possession. Mr. Morton moved into a new house
which he built on Union street, and died July 18, 1902, at the
age of seventy-one years, one month and twenty-one days.</p>

<p>The lot next below the Covington house was all through
my boyhood, as late as 1830, an outlying barn yard, belonging
to Henry Warren, who lived on the corner of North street.
I remember well the large barn on the rear of the lot, and the
extensive hog sty and hog yard on its easterly side. In 1830
the widow of Henry Warren sold the lot to Rev. Frederick
Freeman, who built the house now occupied by Dr. Helen
Pierce. Mr. Freeman was descended from early Plymouth
Colony ancestors, who for many generations lived in Sandwich,
where Mr. Freeman’s grandfather was born. His father,
George W. Freeman, settled in North Carolina and married
Ann Yates Ghobson, and was for a time an instructor in Raleigh,
where he became rector of Christ Church, later accepting
the position of Rector of Emanuel Church in Newcastle,
Delaware. He received in 1839 the degree of Doctor of
Divinity from the University of North Carolina, and October
26, 1844, was consecrated Bishop of the southwestern diocese,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
including Texas, Arkansas and the Indian Territory. He died
at Little Rock, Arkansas, April 29, 1858.</p>

<p>Rev. Frederick Freeman, son of George Ward and Ann
Yates (Ghobson) Freeman, was born in Raleigh, December
1, 1799, and was there ordained as an evangelist. He was
settled in 1824 over the Third Church of Plymouth, whose
place of worship was on the corner of Pleasant and Franklin
streets, and built the house in question in 1830. In 1830 some
disaffection arose in his church, which resulted in the secession
of a considerable number of its members, and the establishment
of the Robinson Congregational church in 1831, and the
erection of its place of worship on the corner of Pleasant
street, and a street which has since been laid out and named
Robinson street. No hint is given so far as I know by any
historian as to the cause of the dissension in the church, but
there are reasons to believe that, brought up in the Episcopal
church, he was never a full fledged Calvinist, and that the
secession above referred to and his final resignation in 1833
were due to this fact. The visit of his father to Plymouth in
1832, and his holding an Episcopal service for only the second
time in the history of the town, tends to confirm this view of
the case. My impression is very strong that sooner or later
after he left Plymouth he became a member in full standing
of the Episcopal church. He afterwards became a citizen of
Sandwich, his ancestral town, and devoted some years to the
preparation and publication of a history of Cape Cod, which
is a valuable contribution to Old Colony Historical literature.
I have a distinct recollection of his personality, a strongly
built man with black hair and a Websterian type of head and
face, who could not pass in a crowd without observation. He
married December 26, 1821, Elizabeth, daughter of George
Nichols of Raleigh, who died in Plymouth March 12, 1833.
He married second, April 20, 1834, Hannah, daughter of
Frederick W. Wolcott of Litchfield, Conn., and third, November,
1841, Isabella, daughter of Hartwell Williams of Augusta,
Maine, but I do not know the date of his death. A
sister of his married Weston R. Gales, mayor of Raleigh, and
hence the name of our late townsman, Weston Gales Freeman
of Summer street.</p>

<p>In 1833 Mr. Freeman sold the house to Daniel Jackson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
who has already been noticed in these memories. After the
death of Mr. Jackson and the removal of his widow to Boston,
Dr. Alexander Jackson became the occupant of the house in
1860, and was succeeded by Dr. Edgar D. Hill in 1880, whose
occupancy last year gave way to that of Dr. Pierce, the present
occupant.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander Jackson was a descendant in the fifth generation
from John Jackson, who came from England and died
in 1731. He was the son of Isaac and Sarah (Thomas) Jackson,
and was born in Winthrop, Maine, May 18, 1819. His
father moved to Boston when he was a boy, and Alexander
was educated at the Boston Latin School, where he fitted for
college. He graduated at Amherst in 1840, and took his
medical degree from the Harvard Medical School in 1843,
having been associated during his three years’ course with the
Boston Dispensary, and the Boston Eye and Ear Infirmary.
Not long after receiving his degree he began the practice of
his profession in Chiltonville, where he remained until October,
1858, when he moved to Main street, Plymouth, and occupied
the house where the Plymouth Savings Bank now
stands. In May, 1860, he moved to the house under consideration
on North street, which he occupied until October,
1880, when he bought the house on Court street, now occupied
by Father Buckley. In October, 1890, he retired from professional
business, and moved to Boston. He married, June 14,
1849, Cordelia A., daughter of Nathaniel Reeves of Wayland,
and had Isaac, 1850, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward
Parrish of Philadelphia; Alexander, 1853, who married
Abby Warren, daughter of William T. Davis of Plymouth;
and Nathaniel Reeves, 1857, who married Hannah M., widow
of George W. Brown, and daughter of Lyman Shaw. Dr.
Jackson died in Boston, December 12, 1901.</p>

<p>Passing now to the house of Arthur Lord on the lower
corner of Rope Walk lane, as it was called, its occupant in
my boyhood was Mrs. William Sturtevant, the widow of William
Sturtevant, who died December 15, 1819. She was the
daughter of Benjamin and Jane (Sturtevant) Warren, and
was born in Plymouth in 1769, and died December 5, 1838.
Her husband was the son of William and Jemima (Shaw)
Sturtevant, and was born in that part of Plympton, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
now Carver, in 1761. I have no means of learning what his
business was, as I am unable to associate him with any enterprise,
industry or profession. He was a member of the Board
of Selectmen in 1817, but I find him in no other office. The
inscription on his gravestone calls him William Sturtevant,
Esq., and as it is certain that he was not a shipmaster or a
lawyer, I am inclined to the opinion that he was a merchant,
and like George Watson, who died in 1800, and William Jackson,
who died in 1837, was called Esquire. Mr. Sturtevant
was married in 1791, and had the following children, who survived
infancy: Jane, 1794; Hannah, 1796; Sarah, 1799; Lucy,
1802; Rebecca W., 1805; and William, 1809. Hannah married
Thomas J. Lobdell, a banker in Boston and died October 3,
1818; William was for a time a partner with William S. Russell
in the dry goods jobbing business in Central street, Boston,
and later a stock broker; Sarah died July 1, 1833; Lucy
died August 7, 1807, and Jane died November 8, 1832. Rebecca
W. married in 1831 Rev. Josiah Moore of Duxbury, and
died April 7, 1838. Mrs. Moore makes the tenth Plymouth
lady whom I remember who married husbands who came to
the town to teach school. These were Nathaniel Bradstreet,
who married Anna Crombie; Charles Burton, who married
Sarah Stephens; George Washington Hosmer, who married
Hannah Poor Kendall; William H. Lord, who married Persis
Kendall; William Parsons Lunt, who married Ellen Hobart
Hedge; Josiah Moore, who married Rebecca W. Sturtevant;
Horace H. Rolfe, who married Mary T. Marcy; Benjamin
Shurtleff, who married Sally Shaw, Isaac Nelson Stoddard,
who married Martha Thomas, and William Whiting, who
married Lydia Cushing Russell. Another might have
been added to the list if a letter of which I was the innocent
bearer, had received a favorable reply. I had no right to
know the contents of the letter, but little pitchers have great
ears, and mine were uncommonly great when I overheard the
letter discussed. The marriage of another teacher, Charles
Field to Elizabeth Hayward, was prevented by his death, August
22, 1838.</p>

<p>In 1839 the house in question was sold to Dr. Timothy Gordon,
who occupied it until his death. Dr. Gordon came to
Plymouth in 1837, but where he lived until he moved into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
Sturtevant house, I am not able to say. His ancestor, Alexander
Gordon, a Scotchman, came to New England in 1651,
and settled in New Hampshire. The Doctor was the son of
Timothy and Lydia Whitmore Gordon, and was born in Newbury,
N. H., March 10, 1795, and made several voyages as supercargo.</p>

<p>In 1823 he entered the office of his brother William in
Hingham, and completed his studies at the Bowdoin College
medical school, where he received a degree in 1825, and first
settled in Weymouth. In 1837 he came to Plymouth, and in
1839 moved into the house in question. He was bold and successful
as a practitioner, and skilful as a surgeon. For many
years he was one of the chief supporters of the Third Church,
and a liberal contributor to its funds, and both he and his wife
made large gifts for the support of foreign missions. He was
a trustee of the Pilgrim Society, and Vice President from 1872
to 1877; a Director of the Plymouth Bank and Plymouth
National Bank from 1845 to 1877, and the recipient of the
degree of Master of Arts from Amherst College in
1868. He married May 12, 1825, Jane Binney, daughter
of Solomon and Sarah Jones, and had two children,
Solomon Jones, September 21, 1826, and Timothy,
April 19, 1836, the latter of whom died young. Dr. Gordon
was a shrewd man, and would have made a good detective, as
the following incident shows. He believed that the methods
pursued in New York and Boston in detecting criminals by the
aid of newspaper reporters was like hunting ducks with a
brass band, and acted accordingly. He had a famous peach
tree in his garden laden with luscious fruit, of which one night
he was robbed. Neither he nor his wife mentioned the loss
even to their servant, and no one knew of the robbery besides
themselves and the thief. One day as the Doctor was sweeping
his sidewalk a man came along and entered into conversation.
Just as he turned to leave he said, “by the way, Doctor,
did you ever find out who stole your peaches.” “Yes, you rascal,”
the Doctor replied. “You stole them, and if you don’t
pay me five dollars instantly I will have you put in jail.” The
man confessed at once, and paid the money down.</p>

<p>Solomon Jones Gordon, the son of Dr. Gordon, was born
in Weymouth, September 24, 1826, and graduated at Harvard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
in 1847. He studied law with Jacob H. Loud in Plymouth,
and in the Harvard Law School, and was admitted to the Suffolk
bar October 18, 1850. He soon after became associated
with Orlando B. Potter, who was interested in sewing machine
patents, and removed his office to New York, where he accumulated
a handsome fortune. He married Rebecca, daughter
of David Ames of Springfield, in which city he made his home
until his death in 1890.</p>

<p>After Dr. Gordon, the house under consideration was successively
occupied by Rev. A. H. Sweetser, pastor of the Universalist
Society, and by Dr. Parker, and the last occupant before
Mr. Lord, its present occupant, was Dr. Warren Pierce.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ought to offer an excuse, for the continuance of
these personal reminiscences which may have become wearisome
to some of my readers. There is a legend that myriads
of sombre birds have periodically flown from the Black Sea to
the beautiful sea of Marmora, and after hovering over the cypress
shades of the cemetery at Scutari have retraced their
flight without food or drink, never touching the earth. The
Turks are said to believe that they are condemned souls denied
the peaceful quiet of the grave, visiting the tombs of others. I
trust that my wanderings among the scenes of the past will not
be attributed to the restlessness of a condemned soul, but rather
to a love of my native town, and of those in whose footsteps
I am daily walking, and in whose vacant homes I recall blessed
memories.</p>

<p>The house on North street, now owned by John Russell, the
occupants of which have been only incidentally alluded to, was
built by Samuel Jackson soon after the revolution and passed
from him to John Russell, who married his daughter Mary.
From John Russell it passed to his son, John, who owned and
occupied it through my boyhood until his death in 1857, from
whom after his widow’s death it passed to his son, John Jackson
Russell, the father of the present owner. John Russell,
whom I remember as the occupant of the house, was the son of
John and Mary (Jackson) Russell, and was born in 1786. In
early life he followed the sea, and soon became master. He
sailed some years in the employ of my grandfather, Wm. Davis,
and I have seen many letters from him in various ports in
the North of Europe, which show him to have been a skilful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
navigator, and an intelligent, shrewd business man. He gave
up the sea before my day, and jointly with Thomas Davis of
Plymouth, and Wm. Perkins and Sydney Bartlett of Boston,
owned the ships Massasoit, Sydney, Granada and Hampden, of
which he was manager. As far as I know his masters were
Robert Cowen, Nathaniel Spooner, Wm. Sylvester, and Henry
Whiting, the latter making a single voyage to California in the
Hampden in 1849. Not long after giving up the sea he became
interested in town affairs, and could always be relied on to oppose
extravagant measures. He was a member of the Board
of Selectmen from 1841 to 1844 inclusive, and in the years
1846, 1851, 1853 and 1854. He was also one of the corporators
of the Plymouth Cordage Company in 1824, and a director
I think until his death. It was during his service as shipmaster
that the political lines began to be drawn between the
advocates and opponents of a protective tariff, the manufacturers
asking for protection, and the ship owners opposing any
measures tending to check importations. His attitude on this
question carried him into the ranks of the Democratic party a
constant opponent of a tariff which, drawn chiefly for protection
purposes, he believed to be unconstitutional. In 1844 the
ship Hampden was in New Orleans loading cotton for Amsterdam,
and either for the benefit of his health or the relief of Capt.
Cowen, he concluded to take command of her for the voyage.
Sending for his son John, who was teaching school in Barnstable
to be his companion, they joined the ship and made the
voyage to Amsterdam and back to Boston or New York, I
think with a load of iron.</p>

<p>Captain Russell married in 1816 Deborah, daughter of Nathaniel
and Mary (Holmes) Spooner, and had Mary Spooner,
who married James T. Hodge, John Jackson, Helen, who married
Wm. Davis and Wm. H. Whitman, and Laura. He died
February 6, 1857.</p>

<p>John Jackson Russell, son of the above, who became the
next occupant of the house in question, was born July 27, 1823,
and graduated at Harvard in 1843. After teaching school in
Barnstable and making a voyage to Amsterdam with his father
in the ship Hampden in 1844, he studied law with Jacob H.
Loud in Plymouth, and Allen Crocker Spooner in Boston, and
was admitted to the Suffolk bar in 1848. Returning to Plymouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
in 1850, after practising law for a time, he was appointed
Assistant Treasurer of the Plymouth Savings Bank, and after
the death of Allen Danforth in 1872 treasurer, which position
he held until his death. He was also a director of the Plymouth
National Bank, and in 1878, a short time its President.
He married in 1855 Mary A., daughter of Allen Danforth, and
had Helen, 1857, John, 1860, and Lydia, 1863. He died November
10, 1897. The house in question in my judgment illustrates
those admirable qualities in architecture, symmetry
and proportion, which are rarely found in the works of architects
of the present day. It illustrates also the importance
of retaining the original color of a house intended by the architect
to be built of brick in order to preserve its symmetry, for
it must be apparent that since the house was painted red the
symmetry has been restored, which a light color had previously
disturbed.</p>

<p>Until within five or six years a house stood on the easterly
side of the Russell house, which during my boyhood was occupied
by Daniel Jackson until 1834, and by Isaac Tribble until
1846, both of whom have already been noticed. In 1846 it
was bought by Anthony Morse, who occupied it until his death.
Mr. Morse was born in Gloucester in 1795, and was the son of
Humphrey and Lydia (Parsons) Morse of that city. He came
to Plymouth when a young man, and learned the trade of rope
making, working a number of years in the rope walk extending
from the gardens of the North street houses along the rear
of the Court street lots to Howland street, and afterwards in
the works of the Robbins Cordage Company. At a later time
he was an assistant in the store of Samuel Robbins on Market
street, and still later he kept a grocery store a short time on his
own account. He was an ardent whig, and during political
campaigns he rendered valuable service to his party by setting
up a reading room, collecting campaign funds, and making
sure of the appearance of whig voters at the polls. Colonel
John B. Thomas was the general adviser of the party, and no
measures were adopted without his approval. One election
morning Col. Thomas was awaked before daylight by a loud
rapping at his door. Opening the window and asking what
was the matter, Morse appeared out of the darkness and called
out, “C-Co-Colonel, rains like h-hell, shall I engage all the h-horses?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
The Colonel said Yes, and went back to bed. As a
reward for his party services he was appointed Deputy Collector
in 1841. Mr. Morse married in 1837 Nancy, widow of
Branch Johnson, and daughter of William Atwood, and had
Charles P., 1830, who kept an apothecary’s shop some years
at the corner of Court and North streets, and later in the house
of his father, to which he succeeded.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse was a man of the strictest integrity, and conscientiousness
was the most marked feature in his character. He
possessed a morbid conscience which kept him in constant fear
that he might be suspected of dishonesty. He was a director
of the Plymouth Bank from 1844 to 1858, and he told me once
that on one occasion when the cashier left him during a temporary
absence to keep the Bank he found a twenty dollar bill
behind a chair on the floor. I found it impossible to convince
him that it had not been placed there to test his honesty. The
morbid state of his mind intensified with age, and he committed
suicide April 19, 1858.</p>

<p>Passing now to the house standing in the angle of Winslow
street, I am led to speak of its occupants for the purpose of
making appropriate mention of Dr. Charles T. Jackson, a distinguished
son of Plymouth, who was there born June 21, 1805.
His father, Charles Jackson, married Lucy, daughter of John
Cotton, in 1794, and his children, whom I remember, were
Lucy, born, 1798, who married Charles Brown, Lydia, 1802,
who married Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Charles Thomas.
Mr. Brown, the husband of Lucy, lived many years in Constantinople,
and rendered laborious and self-sacrificing service
to the sick during a visitation of the plague in that city. Dr.
Jackson studied medicine with Dr. James Jackson and Dr. Walter
Channing of Boston, and graduated at the Harvard Medical
school in 1829. In the same year he went to Europe, where
he remained three years studying in Paris, and returned in
1832. For his scientific labors and researches he was made a
fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>In 1836 he was appointed geologist of Maine, and was also
appointed by Massachusetts to survey her Maine lands. In
1839 he was appointed geologist of Rhode Island, and in 1840
of New Hampshire. In 1844 and 1845, explored the
southern shores of Lake Superior, and opened mines of copper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
In 1847 he superintended for a time a survey of mineral lands
of the United States in Michigan. When Professor S. F. B.
Morse secured a patent for the telegraph in 1840, Dr. Jackson
claimed that on board the ship Sully in 1832, in which he and
Morse were passengers, he suggested the possibility of correspondence
by means of electricity, and explained to Mr. Morse
the method of applying electricity to telegraphic use. It is in
my power to furnish to a certain extent a confirmation of Dr.
Jackson’s claim, which, as far as I know, has not found its
way into the literature of the telegraph. In 1846 I was a passenger
from New York to Liverpool in the ship Liverpool, in
which a man by the name of Blithen was mate, who was also
mate of the ship Sully, in which Jackson and Morse were passengers
in 1832. He told me that he remembered well when
Dr. Jackson made the suggestion of the possibility of an electric
telegraph, at the dinner table, and the interest with which
Mr. Morse listened, and his questionings concerning a possible
use of electricity in the manner proposed. Mr. Blithen said
that it was evident that the subject was a new one to Mr.
Morse, bearing on matters entirely outside of the profession of
painter to which he belonged. The controversy upon the
respective claims of Morse and Jackson never reached a definite
settlement, except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub-silentia</i> by public opinion in favor
of Morse.</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson made another claim, resting on a more substantial
basis, on which both scientific and general opinion have
been and probably always will be divided. The question
whether he or Dr. W. T. G. Morton was the real discoverer of
anasthesia, will never be settled, and perhaps the only solution
it will reach is that which gives both jointly the credit of the
great discovery. A memorial was presented to Congress in
1852, signed by one hundred and forty-three physicians of Boston
and vicinity, ascribing the discovery exclusively to Dr.
Jackson. The French Academy of Science decreed a Montyon
prize of 2,500 francs to Jackson for the discovery of etherization,
and one of the same amount to Morton for the application
of the discovery to surgical operations. Dr. Jackson received
orders and decorations from the governments of France,
Sweden, Prussia, Turkey and Sardinia, but what the final verdict
of history, the court of last resort, will be, it is too early
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Jackson was a man of broad and deep scientific learning,
and in exploring the mysteries lying in the field of science he
found so much that his frank and open nature would not permit
him to conceal, that those who knew him were not surprised
at the disputed claims which marked his career. He
knew too much, and too many things for him to develop, and
by his own labors to apply to practical use. His mind was
like a garden so crowded with vegetation of his own planting
that none or few reached perfect bloom and seed. But the
passerby attracted by one or another, though ignorant of botany,
would pluck a slip or a root, and setting it in his own
grounds, by unremitting care nurse it into vigorous growth and
a perfected life. Without the garden which the gardener had
planted, the passerby would never have found the plant, and
without the act of the passerby the plant would have died and
the labors of the gardener would have been in vain. Thus
it is true that one soweth another reapeth. Dr. Jackson married
Susan Bridge of Charlestown, and died in 1880.</p>

<p>At the time the controversy between Jackson and Morton
was going on, Horace Wells, a dentist in Hartford, made a
claim that prior to the use of ether he had used in his profession
nitrous oxide gas to prevent pain. In the autumn of
1846 he went to Europe to lay his discovery before the medical
profession in Paris, and in March, 1847, on his return, he was
my fellow passenger on board the steamship Hibernia, and
shared my stateroom. He was a landsman, unfamiliar with
the sea, and easily frightened by the noises of the ship. He
was especially frightened on a dark night in a northwest gale
surrounded by broken ice off the Flemish cap, the northeast
edge of the grand banks. As we entered the field ice Capt.
Harrison deemed it prudent to stand to the southward and escape
it. We were constantly feeling the huge blocks of ice,
thumping against us, and with the windows of the dining saloon
which was on the main deck, well shuttered, it was about
as dismal a prospect as passengers not yet fully satisfied of the
seaworthiness of sidewheel ocean steamships had ever experienced.
In those days the trumpet was used by the officers
on the deck in giving orders at night or in a storm to the
men at the wheel, and about ten o’clock the few of us who
were not sick, sitting in the saloon, heard the order, “hard a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
port.” Of course we ran to the door, but before reaching it
heard the order, “hard a starboard.” I saw on the port side
perhaps a quarter of a mile distant the glisten of an iceberg,
and those on the starboard side saw the glisten of another about
the same distance away, and as we went wallowing along in
the trough of the sea we sailed between them. We turned
in soon after, but there was not much sleep for the poor Doctor
after the fright he had received.</p>

<p>About midnight we were awakened by the crash on our
decks of a gigantic wave, which enveloped the ship, filling the
dining saloon sill deep, and pouring down into the cabin, endangering
the lives of several passengers whose stateroom
doors were broken open, and who were washed out of their
berths. The Doctor was out and off in an instant, returning
in about ten minutes telling me to get up as the ship was sinking.
As I never was easily rattled, I remained in my berth,
either taking no stock in his outcry, or thinking that a speedy
death in my stateroom would be better than a lingering one
among floating cakes of ice. In the morning we were clear of
the ice, and once more on our course. The troubles to which
Dr. Wells was subjected in endeavoring to substantiate his
claim, affected his brain, and he committed suicide in New
York, January 24, 1848. A statue has been erected to his
memory in the park at Hartford, his native city.</p>

<p>Another distinguished Plymouthean was a resident on North
street. Dr. James Thacher lived from 1817 to 1827 in what
is now called the old part of the Samoset House, which he
named Lagrange in honor of Lafayette, and moved from there
into the Winslow house on North street, which he occupied until
he built the house until recently occupied by Dr. Thomas
B. Drew in or about 1832. I remember him in the Winslow
house, but it was chiefly in the house built by him which he
occupied until his death that I knew him intimately. His
family and my mother were close friends, and I made frequent
visits to his house to talk with him and learn from him tales
and incidents of the past. I always found him sitting at his
desk in the northwest corner of the westerly parlor ready to
talk with a young man who was sufficiently interested in early
days to visit an old man. He was as long ago as I knew
him very deaf, and sometimes, though not always, I talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
with him through an ear trumpet. Like all deaf persons, his
hearing depended much on the tone in which he was addressed,
not necessarily a loud one, but distinct, clear cut, and from
the throat rather than the lips. His wife, whose voice was
low and soft, but clear, conversed with him with ease. He
was a short man, stoutly built, though not fleshy, and always
as long as I knew him, walked with a cane. He was a jovial
man, ready to laugh at a good story, or at a joke on a friend or
on himself. He was an ardent friend of temperance, full of
religious sentiment, but owing to his deafness he was while I
knew him, a rare attendant on church worship. Before my
day he had abandoned the practice of his profession, and was
devoted to literary pursuits.</p>

<p>Dr. Thacher was born in Barnstable, February 14, 1754, and
was the son of John and Content (Norton) Thacher of that
town. He attended the public schools until he was eighteen
years of age, when he was apprenticed to Dr. Abner Hersey
for the study of medicine, completing his apprenticeship at the
age of twenty-one soon after the battle of Bunker Hill. He
at once presented himself for examination for medical service
in the army, and being accepted was appointed surgeon’s mate
in the hospital at Cambridge, under Dr. John Warren. In
February, 1776, after another examination, he was assigned to
Col. Asa Whitcomb’s regiment as mate to Dr. David Townsend,
and went with his regiment on the expedition to Ticonderoga.
In November, 1778, he was appointed surgeon of the
First Virginia State Regiment, and in 1779 he exchanged into
the First Massachusetts Regiment commanded by Col. Henry
Jackson, and was present at the execution of Andre. In July,
1781, he was appointed surgeon in the Regiment, commanded
by Col. Alexander Scammel, and was present at the siege of
Yorktown, and the surrender of Cornwallis. Retiring from
service in January, 1783, he settled in the following March in
Plymouth, where he resided until his death. His large experience
in the army, and his well known skill as a surgeon, gave
him a large and lucrative practice, from which he would
have acquired a handsome property, had not his investments
and ventures been disastrous. He established with his brother-in-law,
Dr. Nathan Hayward in 1796, the first stage line between
Plymouth and Boston, which with other enterprises, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
more successful, wasted the savings from his practice. While
carrying on his practice he had in his office a number of
students, among whom were Dr. Perry of Keene, N. H., Dr.
Nathaniel Bradstreet of Newburyport, and Dr. Benjamin
Shurtleff of Carver and Boston. In many things he was
always a little in advance of his generation, and was inclined to
adopt new ideas before they were sufficiently tried, though in
others he was the successful pioneer. He introduced the
tomato into Plymouth, and with my mother, was the first to set
up a coal grate, and use anthracite coal for domestic purpose.</p>

<p>In 1810 Dr. Thacher published “The American Dispensatory,”
and in 1812 “Observations on Hydrophobia.” In 1817
he published “The Modern Practice of Physic,” in 1822 the
“American Orchardist,” and in 1823 “A Military Journal during
the Revolutionary War,” in 1828 “American Medical Biography,”
in 1829, “A Practical Treatise on the Management of
Bees,” in 1831, “An Essay on Demonology, Ghosts, Apparitions
and Popular Superstitions,” and in 1832 a “History of the
Town of Plymouth.” Of some of these books second editions
have been published; some are standard works, and all are rare.
The suggestion I have made that he was in advance of his
time is confirmed by his work on hydrophobia, in which more
than a hint is given that methods of prevention or cure might
be successfully adopted, such as Pasteur has in recent years
advocated. In that work the following passage may be found:</p>

<p>“Experiments made upon the canine poison in brutes might
be considered as an arduous and hazardous undertaking, but it
is not to be deemed altogether impracticable, and I will suggest
the following project for the purpose. In the first place dogs
when affected with madness, instead of being killed, should be
confined and secured that the disease may run its course, and
for the ascertainment of many useful facts connected with its
several stages. If experiments on dogs should be deemed too
hazardous let other animals of little value be selected, provided
a sufficient number can be procured. Having provided for
their security in some proper enclosure, let them be inoculated
with the saliva of the mad dog. With some the inoculated
part might be cut out at different stages to ascertain the latest
period at which it may be done successfully. To others, various
counter poisons and specific remedies might be applied to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
the wound and administered internally. In fact it would be difficult
to determine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, the extent of the advantages of this
novel plan if judiciously conducted. You may smile at my
project, but however chimerical and visionary it may appear,
I would rejoice to be the Jenner of the proposed institution;
though I might fail in realizing my thousands I could pride
myself in being the candidate for the honor, and the author of
an attempt to mitigate the horrors attending one of the greatest
of all human calamities.”</p>

<p>Dr. Thacher received from Harvard the honorary degrees of
Master of Arts and Doctor of Medicine in 1810, and from
Dartmouth in the same year, and was made a Fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He married Susanna,
daughter of Nathan Hayward of Bridgewater, and sister
of Dr. Nathan Hayward of Plymouth, and had Betsey
Hayward, 1785, who married Daniel Robert Elliott of Savannah,
Georgia, and Michael Hodge of Newburyport; Susan,
1788, who died in infancy; James, 1790, who also died in infancy;
James Hersey, 1792, who died in 1793; Susan, 1794,
who married Wm. Bartlett, and Catherine, 1797, who died in
1800. Dr. Thacher died May 26, 1844, and his wife died
May 17, 1842.</p>

<p>James Thacher Hodge, another distinguished son of Plymouth,
was associated with North street, where he had his home
for some years with his mother and his grandfather, Dr.
James Thacher. His father, Michael Hodge of Newburyport,
a graduate of Harvard in the class of 1799, married in 1814
Betsey Hayward, widow of Daniel Robert Elliott of Savannah,
Georgia, and daughter of James and Susannah (Hayward)
Thacher of Plymouth, and James Thacher Hodge, his only
son, was born in Plymouth in 1816. Mr. Hodge graduated at
Harvard in 1836, and at once applied himself to the study of
chemistry, mineralogy and geology, a field of science in which
he was destined to become distinguished. Among his early
labors were those performed with Dr. Chas. T. Jackson, also
a native of Plymouth, on the geological survey of Maine, and
with Professor Henry D. Rogers on the geological survey of
Pennsylvania. He was afterwards engaged in testing and
utilizing the mineral wealth of Lake Superior lands, and the
explorations and reports made by him largely aided in developing
the mining interests of the northwest.</p>

<p>In later times, as one after another, new state and territory
extended our limits in the west, he was among the first to
discover beneath their surface the rich tribute they were ready
to pay as they entered the gates of the union. I believe that
science will find no step treading its paths more vigorous than
his, and no keener eye exploring its mysteries. After a
season’s work on the southern shore of Lake Superior he left
Marquette in the steamer Colburn on the 12th of October,
1871, and on her passage to Detroit the steamer foundered in a
gale and he with others was lost. He inherited from his
grandfather the firmness of nerve which had distinguished,
him in his surgical practice, and from his father, a fearlessness
amounting at times to rashness. Mr. Hodge in preparing
his reports was a careful writer, preferring a criticism for
undue caution to a final discovery of extravagant statements
leading unwary investors to failure and misfortune. Within
the field of his literary efforts must be included some hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
of articles on scientific subjects contributed to the American
Cyclopædia.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodge married in 1846 Mary Spooner, daughter of
John Russell of Plymouth, and had Elizabeth Thacher, who
married George Gibbs of Riverside, Kentucky; John Russell,
1847, who married Harriet, daughter of Seth Evans of Cincinnati;
James Michael, 1850, and Mary, 1854.</p>

<p>I cannot leave North street without a word in memory of
the house in which I was born, March 3, 1822, now occupied
as an Inn, known as the Plymouth Rock House. After my
father’s death in 1824, my mother continued to occupy the
house until 1845, when she moved to the house now occupied
by the Misses Russell, near the head of the street. The succeeding
occupants in their order were Rev. Henry Edes, who
kept a young ladies’ boarding school; Mrs. Sarah Jenkins,
Simon R. Burgess and Charles H. Snell. As long as it was
occupied by our family it had a stable at the westerly end of
the garden on Carver street, and a chaise house opening on
Cole’s Hill, which long since gave way to an enlargement of
the dwelling house.</p>

<p>There have been so many alterations and enlargements in
the house since my mother left it in 1845, that there is little
left as it was in my boyhood. The middle kitchen, as it was
called, with its dresser containing articles in pewter, such as
hot water plates, candle moulds, syphons, etc., and its sink
with a pewter ewer and bowl where I washed my hands when
coming from play, and the long buttery leading out of it where
the flour and sugar barrels and common china and the last
batch of pies were kept, is now an indistinguishable feature
of the house. The large kitchen, too, with its box seat, the
meal chest with compartments for Indian meal, white meal
and rye meal, the coffee grinder on the wall, the mantel with
its row of two wicked brass lamps always clean and bright,
the fireplace with its high andirons, and a four foot stick for a
forestick, a crane with pothooks and a tin kitchen before the
fire, has gone with the rest. Only one room remains as it
was of old, the northeast corner parlor, a room that is historic,
for there the first grate in Plymouth was set in 1832 for
burning anthracite coal for domestic use.</p>

<p>Dr. Thacher and my mother each had a grate set at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
same time, but as his house was not yet finished the fire was
kindled in ours first with coal bought by Capt. George Simmons
in Boston, and brought to Plymouth in the packet sloop
Splendid. Outside of the house the old garden is gone with
its lilac tree announcing by its bloom the advancing step of
summer.</p>

<p>What changes time has wrought in the scenes of my youth.
One feature of these scenes is left to remind me of my Cole’s
Hill home, which years have failed to erase. In my earliest
youth nearly four score years ago a bed of bouncing betts
bloomed on the grassy bank opposite our home, and it is
blooming still as if contesting with me a race for the longest
life. I visit it every year to make sure that it has not given
up the contest, and when I stand by it it seems to say, “Ah,
old fellow, I will beat you yet.” I hope you will, dear friend
of my youth, and bloom on for generations to come, reminding
others as you do me of my childhood days.</p>

<p>I have spoken of N. Russell &amp; Co., and Jeremiah Farris and
Bourne Spooner as connected with manufacturing interests
in Plymouth. There are two others among those who have
passed away, whom I ought to notice, Oliver Edes and Nathaniel
Wood. Mr. Edes was the son of Oliver and Lucy
(Lewis) Edes, and was born in East Needham, November 10,
1815. At the age of sixteen he began to learn the trade of nail
making at works on the Boston mill dam owned by Horace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Gray. He afterwards ran a tack machine in the works of
Apollos Randall &amp; Co., in South Braintree, and at the age of
twenty-two invented a machine for cutting rivets from drawn
wire. Before that time rivets had been made by hand, and it
was difficult to make the trade believe that any but handmade
rivets would meet the wants of mechanics. In 1840 he entered
into a partnership with Andrew Holmes under the firm name
of Holmes, Edes &amp; Co., with a factory at North Marshfield.
At the end of three years the firm was dissolved and a new
one formed between Mr. Edes and Jeremiah Farris, under
the firm name of Edes &amp; Co. At the expiration of a year,
in 1844, the firm moved their business to Plymouth. In 1850
Mr. Edes, having disposed of his interest, formed with Nathaniel
Wood the firm of Edes &amp; Wood, and began the manufacture
of zinc shoe nails and tacks, and soon after the rolling
of zinc plates at Chiltonville. In 1859 he bought out Mr.
Wood, and in 1880, with his son Edwin L. Edes, the partnership
of Oliver Edes and son was formed. In 1883, a partnership
was formed consisting of Oliver Edes, Jason W. Mixter,
Edwin L. Edes and T. E. Heald of Knoxville for the development
of zinc mines in Virginia and Tennessee, and for the
manufacture of zinc metal. He married October 7, 1836,
Susan, daughter of Ebenezer and Lydia (Curtis) Davie, and
had William Wallace, 1847, who married Ellen M., daughter
of Calvin H. Eaton, Lydia Curtis 1851, who married Jason
W. Mixter, and Edwin L., 1853., who married Mary E.,
daughter of Edgar C. Raymond. Mr. Edes died February 21,
1884.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Wood of Dedham married Rhoda Colburn, and
came to Plymouth in the early part of the last century, and had
six children, after 1810, among whom was Nathaniel, who was
born November 25, 1814. The son, Nathaniel, learned the
nail cutter’s trade at the works on the Mill dam in Boston,
owned by Horace Gray, father of the late Horace Gray, associate
justice of the United States Supreme Court. He worked
for some years in the nail factory of N. Russell &amp; Co., and
for a time on his own account in cutting zinc nails and tacks,
and in 1850 formed a partnership with Oliver Edes, under
the firm name of Edes &amp; Wood, in a factory which stood on
Forge pond brook in Chiltonville, where the business was carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
on of making zinc shoe nails and tacks and rolling zinc
plates. In 1859 he sold out his interest to Mr. Edes, and with
Charles O. Churchill, under the firm name of N. Wood &amp; Co.,
continued the business in a factory farther down the stream
on the road leading from the Sandwich road to the old Manomet
road at what was called the Double Brook dam. At a
later time he ran a small factory on Little Brook. He married
in 1837 Angeline, daughter of Lewis and Betsey (Weston)
Finney, and had Warren Colburn, 1840, and Florence A.,
1847. He married second, 1854, Betsey R., daughter of
Charles and Abigail (Russell) Churchill, and had Nathaniel
Russell, 1856, and died April 26, 1888.</p>

<p>Allen Crocker Spooner, whom I knew intimately, was a
brilliant man, who was cut off by death at the threshold of an
especially promising career. He was the son of Capt. Nathaniel
and Lucy (Willard) Spooner, and was born March 9,
1814, in the house on the southerly side of High street, next
west of the house on the corner of Spring street. He graduated
at Harvard in 1835, and was admitted to the Suffolk
bar, September 3, 1839. He belonged to a coterie of scholarly
and jovial men, who met at the eating house of General Bates
once a week, and over their bitter ale were legitimate successors
of the Fleet street club of Johnson and Garrick and Goldsmith.
The members of this coterie were Fay Barrett of Concord,
James Russell Lowell of Cambridge, George W. Minns,
Nathan Hale, Allen Crocker Spooner and John C. King of
Boston and Benjamin Drew of Plymouth. All of these were
Harvard men except King, who was a sculptor, and Benjamin
Drew, a journalist, connected with the Boston <cite>Post</cite>. Their
jokes on each other, though sometimes rough, were always
taken in good part. One evening Minns and Spooner were
walking into town from Cambridge and feeling a little dry in
the throat, Spooner said: “Minns, have you got any money
about your clothes, for I spent my last cent in paying toll?”
“I’ve got just twelve and a half cents,” said Minns, a sum
which was the silver nine pence of that period. Peter B.
Brigham kept a drinking saloon in the old concert hall building
on the corner of Hanover and Court streets, and his drinks
were of two prices, those like Deacon Grant and Dr. Pierpont,
named after distinguished temperance men, were nine pence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and all other common drinks were six and a quarter cents or
four pence half penny. They marched into Brigham’s as if
they were rolling in riches, and as they came to the counter,
Minns said, “Spooner what are you going to have.” Spooner
answered, “I think I will have a Deacon Grant, what are you
going to have?” “Well, I don’t feel very dry, I guess I won’t
take anything.” Mr. Spooner was sought as a guest on many
public occasions, where he was sure to entertain his audience by
either a graceful speech, a bit of humor, or an appropriate
poem. I remember that on one occasion he was invited to join
the Boston underwriters in their annual excursion down Boston
harbor. A little while before, Capt. Jas. Murdock, commanding
the packet ship Ocean Monarch, had run his ship
ashore at Cohasset or Scituate in a fog, though fortunate
enough to get her off. At the lunch of the party on board the
excursion steamer, Mr. Spooner assumed the position of toastmaster,
and calling up the guests one after another, answered
the toasts himself, adopting the personality of each. Among
others he toasted Capt. Murdock, who was present, and kept
the company in a roar by claiming a discovery in the science
of navigation by which he had found that the use of the lead
was an obsolete practice, only persisted in by those who had
not yet learned that ships were constructed to navigate the
ocean and not the land. Capt. Murdock, I believe, was a cabin
window Captain, a fine looking man, jolly good fellow,
popular with his passengers, but not a sailor in the truest sense
of the word. Afterwards in coming down the English channel,
his ship was destroyed by fire off Holy head, and a passenger
whom I knew by the name of Southworth, told me that
Murdock was the first of the ship’s company to reach Liverpool
with news of the disaster.</p>

<p>About the year 1845 Mr. Spooner went to England, a passenger
in the packet ship Devonshire, Capt. Luce, the same
Captain Luce who commanded the Collin’s steamship Arctic,
which was run into by the Brig Vesta, near Cape Race, Sept.
24, 1854, and sunk with the loss of three hundred and fifty
lives. Capt. Luce, whom I afterwards met, told me that when
the ship went down he stood on the paddle box holding his
little boy by the hand and that he thought he would never
stop going down. He had no sooner reached the surface, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
holding his little boy by the hand, than a spar loosened from
the wreck, came up with great force, and striking his son,
killed him instantly. He succeeded in reaching a fragment
of the wreck, and was picked up by one of the brig’s boats.</p>

<p>On his return home, Mr. Spooner told the Boston Old Colony
Club, of which I was a member, that in running into the
harbor of old Plymouth as he lay on deck basking in the sun,
he saw a vessel coming out, which he pictured in his mind as
the Mayflower starting on her voyage to the new world. His
surprise was great when, as the vessel passed, he read on her
stern the name of the Pilgrim ship the Mayflower. My
wonder at the time whether his eyesight was not blurred by an
exuberant imagination was modified at a later time by an incident
within my own experience. On the 19th of August,
1895, in crossing the English channel from Queensboro to
Flushing in Holland, I saw coming from a northern port a
small steamer crossing our course diagonally, almost exactly
the course which the Speedwell steered in August, 1620, in
running from Delfthaven to Southampton, where she joined
the Mayflower. As she passed our stern I was a little startled
as I read the name Speedwell on her bow. I was talking
at the time with two passengers, and calling their attention to
the name of the vessel, I told them the Pilgrim story. Lest
I might be suspected like my friend Spooner of an exuberant
imagination, I examined the British marine register, after my
return home, and found one of the three Speedwells whose
size agreed with the vessel I saw. She belonged in Ipswich,
and I wrote to the owner asking him to advise me of the
whereabouts of his steamer on the 19th of August, 1895.
Unable to find in Boston a Victoria stamp, I was obliged to
send my letter without a return stamp enclosed, and I attribute
to that circumstance my failure to receive a reply. The incident
was especially interesting, as I had just visited Scrooby
for the purpose of placing a bronze tablet on the site of
Scrooby Manor, in which the Pilgrim church was formed, and
was on my way to Leyden, the Pilgrims’ home in Holland.</p>

<p>I shall at this point in my narrative devote some space to
notices of such Plymoutheans as have distinguished themselves
in other localities without regard to the houses with
which by birth or otherwise they may have been associated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
To these will be added notices of a few who were residents
of Plymouth, but who have been in preceding chapters only
incidentally alluded to.</p>

<p>William G. Russell was the son of Thomas and Mary Ann
(Goodwin) Russell, and was born in Plymouth, November
18, 1821. After attending the public schools he was fitted for
college by Hon. John A. Shaw of Bridgewater, and graduated
at Harvard in 1840. After teaching in a private school in
Plymouth a short time, and in the Dracut Academy a year,
he studied law in the office of his brother-in-law, Wm. Whiting,
and at the Harvard Law School, receiving from the latter
the degree of LL. B. in 1845, and being admitted to the
Suffolk bar July 25, 1848. He was at once associated with
Mr. Whiting as a partner, and while the latter was holding
the position of solicitor of the War Department from 1862 to
1865, the business of the firm devolved on him. After the
death of Mr. Whiting in 1873, George Putnam joined him
as a partner, and at a later period, Jabez Fox was added to the
firm. After the death of Sydney Bartlett he was universally
recognized as the leader of the Suffolk bar, and was offered a
seat on the bench of the Supreme Judicial Court, both as associate
and chief justice. He was a member of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and at various times held the
positions of President of the Union Club, the social library
association, and the Suffolk bar association; vice president of
the Pilgrim Society, director of the Mount Vernon National
Bank, and the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Co.,
and Harvard overseer from 1869 to 1881, and from 1882 to
1894. He married October 6, 1847, Mary Ellen, daughter of
Thomas and Lydia Coffin Hedge of Plymouth, and died in
Boston, February 6, 1896.</p>

<p>Thomas Russell, brother of the above, was born in Plymouth,
September 26, 1825, and graduated at Harvard in 1845.
He studied law with Whiting &amp; Russell in Boston, and was
admitted to the Suffolk bar November 12, 1849. He was
appointed Justice of the Police Court of Boston, February 26,
1852, and in 1859 on the establishment of the Superior Court
was appointed one of its associate justices. While he was on
the bench a number of cases of garrotting and robbery occurred
on Boston Commons, which for a time made the Common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
dangerous to cross in the evening. The first person charged
with the offence was tried before Judge Russell, and convicted,
and the severe sentence imposed by him put an end to the
commission of the crime. In 1867 he resigned his seat on the
Superior bench, and on the accession of General Grant to the
Presidency, was appointed collector of the port of Boston.
During General Grant’s second term he resigned the collectorship,
and was appointed minister to the Republic of Venezuela,
where he remained several years. He was a Harvard overseer
from 1855 to 1867; a Trustee of the State Nautical School
several years, and in 1879 was chosen President of the Pilgrim
Society, holding that position until his death. The judge was
an ardent republican, and being a ready speaker, was always
in demand on the political stump. He was occasionally selected
for the delivery of formal orations, the most notable of
which occurring to me were a fourth of July oration before the
Boston City Government, and a eulogy on General Grant delivered
in Plymouth. He married in 1853 Mary Ellen, daughter
of Rev. Edward T. Taylor of Boston, and died in Boston,
February 9, 1887.</p>

<p>Henry Warren Torrey, born in Plymouth, was the son of
John and Marcia Otis (Warren) Torrey. He graduated at
Harvard in 1833, and studied law in the office of his uncle,
Charles Henry Warren in New Bedford. He was at the same
time co-operating with Frederick Percival Leverett in preparing
what is known as Leverett’s latin lexicon, published in
1837. While engaged in that work his eyes became
seriously affected, and practice in the profession of law was
abandoned. I remember that at the time of the great whig
celebration in Boston on the 10th of September, 1840, he was
living in New Bedford, and on that occasion the New Bedford
delegation carried a banner with an inscription of which he
was the author. On the banner a whale ship was painted with
a whale alongside in the process of stripping, and the fires
under the try pots smoking on deck, and beneath was the inscription:
“Martin VanBuren—we have tried him in, and now
we will try him out.”</p>

<p>In 1844 Mr. Torrey was appointed tutor at Harvard
and instructor in elocution, and served until 1848.
My impression is that from 1848 to 1856 he lived in Hamilton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Place, Boston, and with his sister, Elizabeth, taught a young
ladies’ school. In 1856 he was appointed McLean Professor
of Ancient and Modern History at Harvard, serving until
1886, when on his resignation he was appointed Professor
Emeritus, serving until his death. In 1879 he received the
degree of LL. D. from Harvard, and from 1888 until his
death, he was a Harvard overseer. He was also a member of
the Massachusetts Historical Society, and a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Cambridge
in 1893.</p>

<p>Lemuel Stephens, son of Lemuel and Sally (Morton)
Stephens, was born in Plymouth, February 22, 1814. He belonged
to a sturdy race, and I well remember his grandfather,
William, who was born in 1752. His father, Lemuel and his
uncle William, occupied the two Stephens’ houses between
Union street and the shore, but I am inclined to think, while
Lemuel built the house he occupied, that the house William
occupied was built by his father. Lemuel and William, the
father and uncle of the subject of this notice were engaged
many years in the grand bank fishery, and Stephens’ wharf,
which since the abandonment of the fishery has gradually
crumbled away, presented once a busy scene when the Jane
and Constitution and the Duck and the Industry were fitting
out in the spring, and washing out in the autumn. The
Stephens brothers were men of brains, and consequently men
of ideas, men who were called pessimists because they looked
out for weak spots in government and society, and sought to
correct them. The optimists on the other hand flattered themselves
that everything was right when everything was wrong,
and that the ship was tight, though leaking a thousand strokes
an hour. They were the earliest abolitionists in the town, the
earliest advocates of temperance reform, the earliest promoters
of a well maintained education of the people, while the optimists
as long as they were making money said, “All is well, let
things be.”</p>

<p>Lemuel Stephens of whom I specially speak, the son of
Lemuel, graduated at Harvard in 1835, and soon after graduation
went to Pittsburg in Pennsylvania, where for a time he
taught in a private school. After leaving Pittsburg he went
to Germany for study, spending three years in Heidelberg and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
Gottingen. On his return he was appointed Professor of
chemistry in the western University of Pennsylvania, where
he remained until 1850, when he was appointed professor of
chemistry and physics in Gerard College, continuing in
service until 1885. He married Ann Maria Buckminster of
Framingham, Mass., a relative of Rev. Dr. Joseph Stevens
Buckminster, once pastor of Brattle street church in Boston,
and died in Philadelphia, March 25, 1892.</p>

<p>Another Plymouth man, of whom I must speak, was Winslow
Marston Watson, of whom few of my readers ever heard.
The son of Winslow Watson he was born I think on Clark’s
Island in 1812, and graduated at Harvard in 1833. His
mother, Mrs. Harriet Lothrop Watson, was a close observer
of persons and families, their traits of character and their
relations to each other, and was the first genealogist whom I
ever saw. Her son, Winslow, inherited her powers of observation,
and her remarkable memory, which in a broader sphere
of life made him a reconteur of wide reputation. He early
entered the profession of journalism, and in 1842 I found him,
while on a visit to Troy, the editor of the Troy <cite>Whig</cite>. He
later removed to Washington, where for some years he rendered
valuable service as correspondent of leading newspapers
in New England and New York. His artistic taste and literary
ability attracted the attention of Mr. Corcoran, the
wealthy banker and patron of art, and in his service he performed
appreciative work. I doubt whether any man ever
lived in Washington who came in contact with more persons
of distinction, and could portray their characters and habits
more thoroughly, than Mr. Watson. For nearly forty years
I never failed to see him when visiting Washington, and if
he had followed my advice to publish a book of reminiscences
he would have made a valuable contribution to the literature
of Washington life. His personality was striking, of medium
height and weight, with a fair complexion and large protuberant
blue eyes, with that sad, patient, placid, yet protesting
expression which Homer recognized who called the celestial
queen the ox-eyed Juno. He married in 1852 Louisa
Gibbons, and died in Washington in 1889. He was a cousin
of the late Benjamin Marston Watson, of whom I have already
spoken, and to whom it occurs to me to refer again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
by inserting the following lines, which I inscribed in a book
presented to him on his last birthday, and which better than
my earlier reference to him, illustrate the beauty of his character
and life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A placid stream, with flowers on either hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And meads beyond, tempting the eye of art;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With here and there a ripple as it runs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against opposing winds, or flows triumphant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over hidden shoals, with lips upturned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And smiling in the noonday sun.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such, my dear friend, has been thy life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twere vain to wish it ever thus to be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For every stream must some time reach the sea.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There lived in my youth on the lower corner of Summer
and Spring streets an elderly gentleman of kind words and
gentle speech, who, though living a distance from my home,
early attracted me and found a lasting place in my memory.
From 1806 to 1819, he had been treasurer of the town, and
was some years a teacher in what was later called the high
school. His name was Benjamin Drew, and he was the father
of my long time friend, Benjamin Drew, who died in 1903.
He was something of a poet, and his son told the story that
one time when asked to contribute an inscription to be placed
on the gravestone of his brother-in-law, Barnabas Holmes, he
composed the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">By temperance taught, a few advancing slow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To distant fate by easy journeys go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calmly they lie them down like evening sheep,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On their own woolly fleeces softly sleep.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Objection was made to the inscription by the family of Mr.
Holmes, it appearing too personal, as Mr. Holmes had been a
dealer in mutton. Like most emasculated poetry the substitute
adopted was tame—as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">By temperance governed, and by reason taught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The paths of peace and pleasantness he sought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With competence and length of days was blest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cheered with hopes of everlasting rest.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He married in 1797 Sophia, daughter of Sylvanus and Martha
(Wait) Bartlett. His son, Benjamin, of whom I especially
speak in this notice, was born in Plymouth, November 28,
1812. He was educated at the public schools, leaving the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
school about four years before I entered it. After leaving
school he entered the office of the <cite>Old Colony Memorial</cite> to
learn the printer’s trade, and there laid the foundation of his
reputation as an expert in typography. About the year 1835
he began his career as teacher, and during a period of twenty-five
years taught in the Phillips, Otis, Mayhew and Glover
schools in Boston. While living in Boston his companionship
was prized by scholarly men, and he was one of a group of
social fellows already referred to who met at a saloon in Cornhill
square, called the Shades, kept by General Bates, a Scotchman.
There the group would frequently meet in Bohemian
fashion to exchange witticisms and criticisms and enjoy a mug
of ale. These occasional opportunities to give vent to his
sense of humor were not sufficient to exhaust his flow of wit
and under the cognomen of Ensign Stebbins he often wrote
for the “carpet bag,” and was always a welcome contributor to
the humorous columns of the <cite>Boston Post</cite>, I remember reading
a squib of his in the <cite>Post</cite> sixty years ago, representing a
showman explaining and describing to his audience the various
features of his exhibition, as for instance:</p>

<p>“This, ladies and gentlemen, is the zebra, it measures ten feet
from head to tail, and eleven feet from tail to head, has
twelve stripes along its back and nary one alike.”</p>

<p>“This is the hippopotamus, an amphibious animal, what dies
in the water and can’t live on the land.”</p>

<p>“This, ladies and gentlemen, is the shoved over of the
scalper’s art, the statute of Apollos spoken of in the acts of
the Apostles, where it says that Paul doth plant and Apollos
water, and to illustrate the text more fully I have appended to
his left hand a large, tin watering pot, which I bought of a
tin peddler for thirty-seven and a half cents.”</p>

<p>About 1860 Mr. Drew went to St. Paul, where he taught
school a year, and then for some years he performed the duties
of proof reader in the Government printing office in Washington.
In 1881 he made a journey around the world, spending
a short time on the way with his son Edward Bangs Drew,
a Mandarin in the Chinese Imperial Customs Service, with
headquarters at Tientsin, where he passed his 70th birthday.
On his return he settled permanently in his native town, recalling
the scenes and friends of earlier days, and roaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
among the haunts of the fathers of the town. He published
during his life a book entitled “Pens and Types,” a standard
work on typography, and another entitled, “The North side of
slavery,” and after his final return to Plymouth he published
a valuable descriptive catalogue of the gravestones and inscriptions
on Plymouth Burial Hill. He married Caroline Bangs
of Brewster, and died in Plymouth July 19, 1903, at the age
of ninety years, seven months and twenty-one days.</p>

<p>Zabdiel Sampson, son of George and Hannah (Cooper)
Sampson, was born in Plympton in 1781, and graduated at
Brown University in 1803. He studied law with Joshua
Thomas, and settled in Plymouth. In 1816 he was chosen
member of Congress, and in 1820 was appointed collector of
the port of Plymouth to succeed Henry Warren. At that time
political lines were in a comparatively subdued and inactive
state. The loose constructionist or federal party was still in
existence, but declining in strength and power. Monroe, a
strict constructionist or Democratic Republican, was re-elected
with practical unanimity, while the campaign of 1824 was
rather a personal contest between John Quincy Adams and Andrew
Jackson, than a party struggle. During the administration
of Adams the name National Republican took the place of Federalist,
and the Democratic Republican party assumed the
name of Democrat. Thus parties remained until the campaign
of 1832, when the National Republicans assumed the name
of Whigs. Thus the two great parties continued until 1856,
when the Republican party was born. There were splinters
from these parties at various times, such as the anti-masonic
party in 1830, the liberty party in 1839, the free soil party in
1848 and the American party in 1852, as there are now splinters
from the Democratic and Republican parties like the temperance
and labor parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Sampson was undoubtedly when appointed collector in
1820 a Monroe strict constructionist, or in other words a
Democrat, but retained the office through the Adams administration
because during that period party lines were loosely
drawn. He died while in office, July 19, 1828. He was a
member of the board of selectmen eight years, during five of
which he was its chairman. He married in 1804, Ruth, daughter
of Ebenezer Lobdell of Plympton, and had ten children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
neither of whom I think has descendants living in Plymouth.</p>

<p>I have said that the presidential contest in 1824 was a personal
one between Adams and Jackson. Then began the hostility
between these two men, which was never placated. General
Jackson died June 8, 1845, before the days of the telegraph,
and rumors of his death drifted to the East several
times before the event occurred. Rev. Dr. Wm. P. Lunt, Mr.
Adams’ pastor in Quincy, told me that while in Boston one
day, authentic news of Jackson’s death was received, and on
his return home he thought it proper for him to call at Mr.
Adams’ house and communicate to him the sad news. As he
entered the library Mr. Adams was standing with his back to
the door, looking over some papers on a window seat. He said,
“Mr. Adams, I heard in Boston this afternoon the sad news
of the death of General Jackson, your successor in the presidential
chair.” Mr. Adams, without looking round or stopping
in his work exclaimed, “Umph, the old rascal is dead at last,
is he?”</p>

<p>Schuyler Sampson, brother of the above mentioned Zabdiel,
was born in Plympton in March, 1787, but moved with his
father to Plymouth when young. I am inclined to think that
he and his brother lived for some years in the house which
until recently stood on the corner of Summer street and Spring
hill. All through my boyhood, however, and until his death,
he owned and occupied the house on the northerly side of Summer
street, next westerly of the house for many years occupied
by Benjamin Hathaway. He was for several years a member
of the board of selectmen, and in 1828 was appointed to succeed
his brother as collector of the port. He served in the latter
office during the administrations of Jackson and Van Buren,
and in 1841 succeeded Ebenezer G. Parker as cashier of the
Old Colony Bank. He married in 1823 Mary Ann, daughter
of Amasa Bartlett, and had Mary Ann Bartlett, 1825, who
married George Gustavus Dyer. He married second, 1827,
Sarah Taylor (Bartlett) Bishop, sister of his first wife, and
widow of Wm. Bishop. By his second wife he had Sarah Taylor
Bartlett, 1829, George Schuyler, 1833 and Hannah Bartlett,
1835, who married Rev. Isaac C. White. The late Wm.
Bishop of Boston was the son of the second wife by her first
husband. Mr. Sampson died in Plymouth May 10, 1855.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>During my boyhood Truman Bartlett lived on the northerly
side of High street, west of Spring street. He was a tall,
robust man, weighing I should judge about two hundred and
twenty-five pounds, and I remember him well with his plaid
Camlet cloak which he wore in the winter, reminding me of
the outer cold weather garment worn by the watchmen in Boston
before the police patrol was established in that city. He
was the son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Jackson) Bartlett, and
was born in Plymouth, March 10, 1776. He was a shipmaster
for many years, and sailed for my grandfather, Wm.
Davis and Barnabas Hedge. He married in 1798 Experience,
daughter of Robert Finney, and had William, Josiah, Flavel,
Charles, Stephen, Truman, Azariah, Ann, Lucia and Angeline.
Of these Angeline died at the age of twenty, April 24, 1838,
and Charles died in childhood in 1826; Lucia died October 3,
1841, at the age of twenty-eight, and of Ann I know nothing.
The remaining six sons all became shipmasters, and formed
a group of merchant captains, such as no other Plymouth
family can match. Of William, who commanded the Charles
Bartlett, and Truman, who commanded the Queen of the
East, I have already spoken, but of the others I have no reliable
record. Captain Bartlett died August 18, 1841.</p>

<p>Ezra Finney, called Captain, lived on the northwesterly corner
of Summer and Spring streets from 1822, until his death.
He was the son of Ezra and Hannah (Luce) Finney, and was
born in Plymouth July 5, 1772. He may have been a shipmaster
in his early days, and his connection with the Old
Colony Insurance Company, of which he was at one time President,
as well as his ownership and management of navigation,
renders such an occupation probable. He was a member
of the board of selectmen three years, and the absence of his
name in connection with the whale fishery suggests a conservatism
in business affairs which precluded investments over
which he could have no personal supervision. In navigation
he was enterprising and successful, but as far as I know never
engaged in the grand bank fishery. He married in 1797 Lydia,
daughter of Andrew Bartlett, and had Lydia Bartlett, 1799,
who married Capt. Lemuel Clark, Ezra, 1804, who married
John Bartlett. He married second 1808, Betsey, widow of
John Bishop, and daughter of Eliphalet Holbrook, Eliza, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
had Betsey Bishop, 1809, who married William Sampson Bartlett;
Mary Coville, 1811; Caroline, 1814; Ezra, 1817; Mary
Coville, 1819, who married Henry Mills; and Caroline, 1822.
Abby, daughter of Captain Finney’s second wife by her first
husband, John Bishop, was born in 1801, and married James
E. Leonard and Henry Mills.</p>

<p>It was the custom under what was called the Suffolk Bank
system, when banks were forbidden by law to pay out any
bills but their own to send every two or three days all foreign
bills received by the banks to the Suffolk
bank in Boston and receive from that bank their own bills in
return. As expresses were not established in Plymouth until
after 1845 packages of bills to or from the Suffolk bank were
entrusted to any friend of the Plymouth or Old Colony Bank,
as they were to myself even when a boy. On one
occasion Mr. Finney received from the Suffolk bank a package
of the bills of the Old Colony Bank. Chilled by his ride
from Boston in a stage sleigh, it was not until he had thawed
out by the home fire that the package was brought to his mind.
It was not in his pockets, nor was it to be found anywhere in
the house. As a last resort he hurried to the stage stable,
where his anxiety was relieved by the discovery of the package
hidden by the straw with which the floor of the sleigh was
covered. This incident was far from being indicative of
carelessness on his part, for he was a methodical business man,
and one as thoughtful of the interests of others as of his own.
On another occasion he proved himself a thrifty trustee of the
Savings Bank. Mr. Danforth, the treasurer, having occasion
to leave town for a day or perhaps two, left Mr. Finney in
charge of the bank, and among the contents of the safe was
a strapped package of counterfeit bills which had been collecting
for some time, and had been charged off to profit
and loss. On Mr. Danforth’s return, not finding the package,
he asked Mr. Finney if he had seen the bills, and Mr.
Finney replied that he had, and not doubting them genuine,
had paid them out. The bills were never heard from afterwards,
and their amount was in due time credited back to
profit and loss. Captain Finney died February 5, 1861.</p>

<p>Andrew Bartlett, son of Andrew and Sarah Holbrook Bartlett,
was born in Plymouth, October 20, 1806, and lived in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
High street, near his kinsman, Truman Bartlett. He was a
shipmaster, possessing those qualities which made him not
only a skilful navigator, but a prudent, economical and trustworthy
business man. He told me once that during his career
as master, he had never lost a man or a spar. While this fact
speaks well for his seamanship, it was due largely to the
models of vessels in his day, and the absence of those hasty
methods of doing business which characterize our times. A
blunt bow and a full counter made it easy to encounter a head
sea, and to leave a following one, while there was enough left
of the old kettle bottom to check the shift of even a cargo of
railroad iron, which, however securely braced, is always ready
to start with the kick of a rolling sea. Safety to ship and
cargo, not speed, was the great consideration sought. When
Capt. Fox in the brig Emerald, after a thirteen days’ passage
from Liverpool, rounded to off Long wharf and was
hailed with the question, “When did you leave Liverpool,
Capt. Fox,” his reply was, “Last week, damn you, when do
you think?” He did not say how many sails he had lost, nor
whether his cargo in the forehold was dry. I think Capt.
Bartlett sailed for a combination of owners of whom Ezra
Finney, Wm. Nelson and Benjamin Barnes were the chief.</p>

<p>After abandoning the sea his interests in seamen led him
to devote his life to their service in connection with the sailors’
Bethel and Home in Boston. He married in 1830 Mary,
daughter of William Barnes of Plymouth, and had Victor A.,
1841, Mary E., 1843 and Andrew P., 1848. He married second,
in 1866, Phebe J. Tenney, who had been for a number
of years a school teacher in Plymouth. Captain Bartlett
died February 4, 1882.</p>

<p>William Nelson, son of William and Bathsheba (Lothrop)
Nelson, was born in Plymouth, September 29, 1796, on the
old Nelson farm near Cold Spring, which had been in the
Nelson family from the time of its first American ancestor,
William Nelson, who married Martha, daughter of widow
Ford, who came to Plymouth in the ship Fortune in 1621. I
think Mr. Nelson lived on High street until 1841, when he
built and occupied until his death the house on Summer street,
which in 1867 was sold to Barnabas Churchill. He had a
sister, Mary Lothrop Nelson, who married Jesse Harlow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
he with Mr. Harlow, under the firm name of Nelson &amp; Harlow,
was engaged some years in navigation, with a counting room
on the westerly side of Water street, opposite to Nelson’s
wharf. He was a director in the Old Colony Bank, and in
the Old Colony Insurance Company, a prominent member of
the Orthodox Congregational church, and a liberal contributor
to its support. He married in 1821 Sarah, daughter of
Josiah Carver, and had William Henry, 1830, who is noticed
at the end of this chapter; Thomas Lothrop, 1833, who married
Susan A. Warren of Exeter, N. H., and Mary Stratton
of Atchison, Miss.; and Sarah Elizabeth, who married Wm.
K. Churchill. Mr. Nelson died October 6, 1863.</p>

<p>There is one whom I omitted in my wanderings in the
northerly part of Court street, of whom I shall be glad to
speak. I heard much of him in my youth, though he died before
my birth, and of the disappointment which his premature
death caused to be felt by his friends. Isaac Eames Cobb, the
son of Cornelius and Grace (Eames) Cobb, was born January
19, 1789, in the old Nehemiah Savery house, still standing
south of Cherry street, a little back from Court street. He
graduated at Harvard in 1814 a leading scholar in his class,
and began the study of law. A disease of the lungs obliged
him to abandon a profession in which there was every reason
to believe that he would have a successful career. He entered
into business with Messrs. Isaac L. and Thomas Hedge, but
died a victim of consumption January 14, 1821. He married
in 1816 Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Bartlett, whose house
occupied the site on which that of Gideon F. Holmes now
stands. His daughter Elizabeth, the widow of Joseph Holmes,
lives in a house standing on what was a part of her grandfather
Bartlett’s estate. The following inscription is on his
gravestone on Burial Hill:</p>

</div>

<p>No man was better known in Plymouth in his day than
Joseph Lucas. He was a son of Joseph and Ruby Lucas of
Plympton, and was born in that town in February, 1785. He
learned the nail cutter’s trade, and worked at it many years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
in the works of N. Russell &amp; Co. His work was something
more than perfunctory, for it not only led him into a study of
machinery with its needed improvements, but it gave him also
an opportunity to ponder over worldly affairs beyond the
horizon of his daily occupation. His ingenuity suggested useful
improvements in nail cutting machines, which proved
profitable to both his employers and himself. Mr. Lucas was
an ardent whig, and as a manufacturer was a supporter of the
tariff policy of his party, little thinking that within thirty-five
years of his death the tariff policy which he advocated would
by the imposition of high duties on coal and iron wipe out of
existence the nail cutting business of New England.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas was often sought to represent the town in the
General Court, and in the house of representatives his name
was as much identified with Plymouth as that of Kellogg with
Pittsfield; Banning with Lee; Lawrence with Belchertown, or
Lee with Templeton. In his day it was not the custom as it
is now, to nominate one of two or three who set themselves
up as candidates, but the voters selected the men they wanted
for representatives, believing that laws to be respected must be
enacted by men of good judgment and superior intelligence.
Mr. Lucas married in 1823 Lydia, daughter of William and
Lydia (Holmes) Keen, and had Augustus Henry, 1824; Catherine
Amelia, 1825, and Frederick William, 1831. Mr. Lucas
died January 13, 1871.</p>

<p>Before crossing Town Brook I must speak of Joseph P.
Brown and Wm. H. Nelson, though they are not associated
with the remote history of our town. Mr. Brown was the son
of Lemuel Brown, and was born December 12, 1812. His
father was a cabinet maker who came to Plymouth with a wife,
Sarah Palmer of Cambridge, and established himself in business
with a shop in the rear of the house next west of the
present residence of the Misses Rich on Summer street. He
did good work, and I know many mahogany chairs of his
workmanship still doing good service in the parlors of some
of my friends. His two sons, Stephen P. and Joseph P., learned
the trade of their father, and in later years carried on
business on the south side of High street, and in the building,
a part of which is occupied by the provision market of C. B.
Harlow on Market street. At a still later time Joseph P.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
carried on the same business in the old Plymouth bank building
on Court street. Joseph was on the board of selectmen
with me from 1856 to 1860, inclusive, and I am glad of the
opportunity to attest his usefulness and fidelity in the management
of town affairs. He was a man of dry humor, and
had many a story to tell, often provoking a laugh against himself.
He chewed tobacco freely, and was obliged before speaking
to deliver himself of the saliva which had been accumulating.
I remember that one autumn afternoon when the board
had been visiting the south end of the town, we stopped at
the house of David Clark, a member of the board, to leave
him, and went into the house to warm ourselves. As we
sat around the wood fire I noticed a couple of herrings roasting
in the ashes for supper. Before Mr. Brown could answer
a question I put to him he was obliged to relieve his mouth
of its contents, and he discharged them squarely upon the
herrings, completely covering them. Nothing was said, and
I did not suppose that any one but myself noticed the catastrophe.
After we had started for home, Mr. Brown turning
to me said, “Good heavens, Davis, did you see me baste those
herrings?”</p>

<p>He told me once of an expedition to Sandwich to bring
home his wife’s invalid sister, who had been visiting there.
He started one November morning about four o’clock, and
after driving two hours he came to a cross road, and seeing
a light in a house, stopped to inquire the way. On rapping at
the door a man appeared with a lamp in his hand, whom he
recognized as John Harlow, an old resident of Chiltonville.
“What are you doing, John, down here in Sandwich,” he
asked, and John replied, “I guess, mister, your morning toddy
was a little strong, I am in Chiltonville, not Sandwich.” Then
for the first time recognizing his visitor, he added, “Why, Mr.
Brown, what are you doing here at this time in the morning?”
“Why, John, I started for Sandwich, but at the rate of progress
I have made I don’t think I shall get there much before
night.” The trouble was that his horse, following the track
which suited him best, had after leaving the Cornish tavern,
borne constantly to the left and traversed the Beaver Dam
road, and the road over the Pine Hills until he reached the
Harlow house, four miles from his starting point two hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
before. Mr. Brown married in 1837 Margaret, daughter of
George Washburn, and died June 23, 1877.</p>

<p>William H. Nelson was the son of William and Sarah (Carver)
Nelson, and was born August 13, 1830. After leaving
school he was a clerk for a time in the hardware establishment
of Cotton, Hill &amp; Co., in Boston, but eventually established
himself in business in his native town. As well as I can remember
he first embarked in the grand bank fishery, supplemented
by the mackerel fishery. Gradually enlarging his fleet,
and also the size of his vessels, he extended his business operations
by either chartering some of his vessels to Boston merchants
engaged in the West India trade, or engaging himself
in that trade. Building from time to time still larger vessels
which were employed entirely under charter, his fishing interests
became a secondary matter. By prudence and sagacity,
his business was made successful and profitable, and as he
won the confidence of his fellow citizens, he was sought for in
the management of institutions and public affairs. He was a
director of the Old Colony National Bank many years, and
after the death of George Gustavus Dyer for a short time,
until his own death, its President. His chief service, and
one which made him respected, and his trustworthiness relied
upon by his fellow citizens, was that rendered by him on the
board of selectmen, of which he was a member for twenty
years, and chairman sixteen years. As manager of town affairs
he was conservative and faithful to his trust, never hasty in the
support of new schemes, but sure in the end to support them
when satisfied of their merit. He married Hannah Coomer,
daughter of Coomer Weston, Jr., and died July 18, 1891.</p>

<p>I have thus far in my wanderings omitted to mention any
member of the Harlow family, scarcely one of whom can be
found on the north side of Town Brook. But in crossing the
brook I am at once confronted by three Harlow houses, standing
like sentinels to guard what may be considered their
family domain. These are the houses which in an earlier generation
were occupied by Ephraim, Sylvanus and George Harlow.
In my study of family names I have often found them
confining themselves within certain town bounds. For instance
there are the names of Stetson, Gray and Willis in
Kingston; Sprague, Weston, Winsor and Soule in Duxbury;
Lobdell, Harrub and Parker in Plympton, and of Ransom and
Vaughan and Murdock in Carver, all like the clans of Scotland,
keeping within their own borders. Nor were the limits
within which the various names were found always as broad
as the bounds of the towns. As for instance there were on
the north side of the brook the Jacksons, Russells, Hedges,
Spooners, Cottons, etc., and on the south side the Harlows,
Dotens, Stephens and Barnes, representatives of each succeeding
generation, settling among the familiar scenes of their
youth. A hundred years, or perhaps more, ago, it was the
custom in town meeting to divide the house in voting on important
questions, the affirmative voters gathering on the north
side, and the negative on the south. On one occasion after the
division, but before the count, the moderator called out—a
Ponds man on the wrong side of the house. When I see
the sign of C. B. Harlow on Market street I am tempted to
say, a Harlow man on the wrong side of the brook. In 1851
I was riding from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Shelburne, and
stopped at the inn in Liverpool for dinner. While eating
alone, the landlord came into the dining room and entered into
conversation. I asked him his name, and he said, Bradford
Harlow, and in answer to my inquiry where he came from he
said, “You may guess a hundred times and you will not guess
right.” “Well,” I said, “I will venture to say that either you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
or your father came from Plymouth in Massachusetts.” “By
George,” he exclaimed, pounding his hand down on the table,
“You have guessed right the first time.” I then told him I
was a Plymouth man, and I did not believe such a combination
of names could be found in any other town. His father
was a ship carpenter, who after the Revolution moved down
to Liverpool to work at his trade, and made that town his
future residence. For some reason, which I cannot satisfactorily
explain, there was at that time quite a migration of ship
carpenters from Plymouth to Nova Scotia, which was made
practicable by the frequent resort of Plymouth vessels
bound to the fishing banks, to the harbors of Shelburne
and Barrington and Liverpool. Among them
were William Drew, who went to Liverpool, and James
Cox, who went to Shelburne, the latter of whom married
there Elizabeth Rowland about the year 1800, and continued
there until his death. The late William Rowland Cox of
Chiltonville, a son of James, and a well known master carpenter,
came to Plymouth as long ago as I can remember, and
Martha Taylor, a daughter, also came and married Ephraim
Bartlett, whose daughter Martha Ann, widow of the late Geo.
E. Morton, is a much respected resident of Plymouth.</p>

<p>Ephraim Harlow, above mentioned, was the son of Sylvanus
and Desire (Sampson) Harlow, and was born in 1770. He
was somewhat extensively engaged in navigation and real
estate. In navigation he not only built one or more vessels
on his own account, but he was also associated with James
Bartlett, Jr., and others, in building the bark Fortune in 1822
for the whale fishery, and at a later period in building the
schooner Maracaibo, for the same business. In the early part
of the last century he owned in connection with his brother
Jesse, Nathaniel Carver, and Benjamin M. Watson all the
land on the west side of Pleasant street, between the brook and
Jefferson street extending back to the poor house land, the
northeasterly part of which, after sundry sales and divisions,
came into his sole possession. On this part he built the house
which he occupied until his death, on Robinson street in the
rear of the old Robinson church. In the rear of his house
he opened a Court in 1825, and built a house which was occupied
by James Morton, sexton of the Unitarian church, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
I remember sitting during the service at the head of the
south pulpit stairs. Mr. Harlow was a man of tried probity
and intelligence, receptive of various measures of reform, such
as anti-slavery and temperance measures, which both he and
his family did much to support. He married in 1794 Jerusha,
daughter of Thos. Doten, and had Jerusha Howes, Ephraim,
Thos. Doten and Jabez. He married second, Ruth, daughter
of William Sturtevant of Carver and had Jane, 1808, who
married Atwood L. Drew, Hannah Shaw, 1810, who married
George Adams, Ruth Sturtevant, 1815, whose early death was
lamented by a large circle of friends; Zilpha Washburn, 1818,
who married Nathaniel Bourne Spooner, and Desire Sampson,
1821. He died December 15, 1859.</p>

<p>The house on the corner of Pleasant and Sandwich streets,
now occupied by William H. Harlow, was built by his grandfather,
Jesse Harlow, not long after the Revolution, and in
my early days was occupied by David Harlow, the father of
the present occupant, who kept a store there for many years.
David Harlow married in 1823, Eliza Sherman, daughter of
Lewis and Betsey (Weston) Finney, and had David L., who
married Lucy Cook of Kingston; Isaac Newton, who married
Catherine Weston; Henry M., who married Sarah F. Cowen;
Ezra, who married Catherine Covington; Ann Eliza, Hannah,
Pelham W., who married Etta H. Mayo; Edward P.,
who married Nancy Sanford of Taunton, and William H.,
who married Annie Gibbs of Providence. David Harlow died
July 22, 1859.</p>

<p>The house on Sandwich street, next but one to the David
Harlow house, was built in 1825 by George Harlow, who
bought the lot on which it stands, in that year from the heirs
of Thomas Doty. George Harlow was the son of Samuel and
Remembrance (Holmes) Harlow, and was born in 1789. He
was in my day chiefly engaged in the Grand Bank fishery. He
married in 1813, Lydia, daughter of Nathaniel Ellis, and had
Nathaniel Ellis, 1813, who married Julia A. Whiting of Bangor;
Lydia, 1819, who married Albert Tribble; Esther, 1821,
who married John Henry Hollis; George Henry, 1823, who
married Sarah E. Morton, and Samuel, who married Mary H.
Bradford. Mr. Harlow died May 9, 1865.</p>

<p>I must not wander far beyond the brook without a notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
of Rev. Adoniram Judson, the distinguished Baptist missionary,
who was a citizen of Plymouth from 1802 to 1812, and
who always, until his death, considered it his American home.
His father, Rev. Adoniram Judson, was born in Woodbury in
1751, and graduated at Yale in 1775. After settlements in
Malden and Wenham he was settled, May 12, 1802, the first
pastor of the third Plymouth church near Training Green. Before
coming to Plymouth he married Abigail, daughter of
Abraham Brown of Tiverton, and had four children, Adoniram,
Elnathan, Abigail Brown and Mary Alice. Elnathan,
born probably in Wenham in 1795, was a surgeon in the United
States Navy, and died in Washington May 8, 1829. Of Mary
Alice I know nothing. Abigail Brown was born in Malden
March 21, 1791, and died in Plymouth, where since 1802 she
had always lived, January 25, 1884. I remember her well,
and many times called at her home to talk with her about her
brother, Adoniram, and his missionary service. She was a
calm, placid woman, with a saintly face, and in everything but
speech resembled a Quakeress. The last time I saw her she
was crossing Town Square on a hot summer day, wearing a
green calash pulled down by the ribbon loop attached to its
front, to protect her face from the rays of the sun. The
father continued his pastorate until 1817, when becoming a
Baptist he resigned, and after preaching for the Plymouth
Baptists, then worshipping in Old Colony Hall, previous to
the erection of their meeting house on Spring street in 1822,
he removed in 1820 to Scituate, where he died November 28,
1826. During his Plymouth pastorate he became the owner
of all the lots of land on the west side of Pleasant street,
which for a time was called Judson street, from the lot now
owned by Chas. P. Hatch to Jefferson street inclusive. On
the Hatch lot he built and occupied the house, which with considerable
alteration is now standing, and in 1808 sold it to his
daughter, Abigail, who made it her home until her death in
1884. Rev. Adoniram Judson, the missionary, son of Rev.
Adoniram and Abigail (Brown) Judson, was born in Malden,
August 9, 1788, and graduated at Brown University in 1807.
After leaving college he taught a private school two years in
Plymouth, where he published the “Young Ladies’ Arithmetic,”
and a work on English Grammar. Until 1810 his religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
views were unsettled, but in that year he joined his father’s
church, and after a short time at the Andover Seminary was
admitted to preach by the Orange Association of Congregational
ministers in Vermont. Having determined to enter the
missionary service, he sailed for England with the view of
making the necessary arrangements, and was captured by a
French privateer, and after a short imprisonment at Bayonne,
reached England, returning in 1811, and being ordained as missionary
at Salem, February 6, 1812. He married February
5, 1812, Ann Hazeltine, of Bradford, Mass., and daughter of
John and Rebecca Hazeltine, and sailed for Calcutta on the
19th of that month. Soon after reaching India he became a
Baptist, and severing his connection with the American Board
he was baptized by Dr. Carey, the English missionary at Serampore.
When the war broke out between the East India
Company and the Burman Government, Dr. Judson was arrested
for alleged complicity with the English, and suffered a
long imprisonment, during which a child, Maria E. B. Judson,
was born, who died April 24, 1827, at the age of two years
and three months. Mrs. Judson died at Amherst, Burman
Empire, October 24, 1826. In 1834 he married Sarah Hall
Boardman, widow of Rev. George Dana Boardman, and daughter
of Ralph and Abiah Hall of Alstead, N. H., who died on
her way to America at St. Helena, September 1, 1845. In the
autumn of that year Dr. Judson made his first and only visit
to the United States, where he remained until July, 1846.
During that visit it was my privilege to meet him. At that
time the mail stage for Boston, leaving Plymouth at half past
ten, met the accommodation stage leaving Boston at eleven
o’clock, and the passengers dined together at the half way
house in West Scituate, and there I met and sat next to him at
the dinner table. He was rather above the average height,
had brown hair, a smooth face, and an expression indicative of
a life of serious thought and sad experience. He reminded
me of portraits of Charles the First, and also of the portrait
now in Pilgrim Hall of Governor Josiah Winslow, in both of
which is depicted the expression to which I have referred.
During his visit he married in June, 1846, Emily Chubbuck, a
native of Eaton, N. Y., known in the literary world as Fanny
Forester, and sailed with her for India in the following month.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
By his second wife his children were Adoniram, Elnathan,
Henry, Edward and Abby Ann, and by his third wife, a daughter,
Emily, who married a Mr. Hanna. Dr. Judson died at sea
April 12, 1850, and his widow returning to America in 1851,
died June 1, 1854. His great literary works were a Burmese
translation of the Scriptures, and a Burmese English dictionary.</p>

<p>Ichabod, son of Ichabod and Sarah (Churchill) Morton, was
born in Plymouth in January, 1790. He always lived in
Wellingsley, but precisely where he was born I am unable to
say. His father built the house now owned by the heirs of
Edwin Morton, when Ichabod was a year old, and there he
lived until he bought in 1829 the house in which he died. For
many years he kept with his brother Edwin, a general store in
a building which was erected and occupied as a dwelling house
by Eleazer Churchill. The firm of I. &amp; E. Morton early added
to their business that of the Grand Bank fishery, and also built
vessels engaged in coastwise and foreign trade. They were the
earliest traders in Plymouth to abandon the sale of intoxicating
liquors, and among the first to join the movement against
the institution of slavery. Mr. Morton became also much
interested in the cause of education, and in town meetings
strongly advocated increasing appropriations for the support
of public schools. When the policy was adopted by the state
of establishing Normal schools, he only needed the co-operation
of the leading men in Plymouth to make his own earnest efforts
successful in securing the location here of the school which
was established in Bridgewater. Horace Mann publicly recognized
in him one of his ablest coadjutors in the cause of education.
For a short time his business was interrupted by his
association with the Brook Farm enterprise, but the dreams of
that social experiment soon gave way to the practical pursuits
of business life. He married Patty, daughter of Coomer
Weston, and had November 22, 1821, a daughter, Abigail, who
married Manuel A. Diaz. He married second Betsey, daughter
of Gideon Holbrook, and had George E., 1829, Nathaniel,
1831, Ichabod, 1833, Austin, 1834, and Howard, 1836, and
died May 10, 1861. Mrs. Diaz, well known as a writer, died
in Belmont in the spring of 1904, and was buried at Mount
Auburn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>One of the measures in which at one time Mr. Morton was
much interested, was that for a division of the town. In 1855,
at the time when the construction of town water works was
decided, it was supposed by many in the south part of the town
that the pecuniary burden which the enterprise would impose
on the town, it was their duty to adopt every means to escape.
Henry W. Cushman, who had been Lieutenant Governor of
Massachusetts from 1851 to 1853, had expressed a desire for
the incorporation of a town bearing his name, and it was understood
that the christening might confer a financial benefit on
the town so named. It was thought therefore that the time was
a favorable one to have the southerly part of the town set off
under the name of Cushman. If I remember rightly the dividing
line asked for in the petition of Caleb Morton and others
ran from the harbor, through Winter and Mount Pleasant
streets. Favorable reports were made in both 1855 and 1856,
but the bills recommended for passage were rejected. Mr.
Morton took an active part in urging the division, but I suspect
that neither he nor any person now living regretted the issue.</p>

<p>Two other attempts to divide the town have been made since
Kingston was set off and incorporated in 1726. In 1783 ten
heads of families representing themselves as composing one-sixth
of the precinct of Manomet Ponds petitioned the General
Court to have Cedarville and Ellisville set off to Sandwich.
The petitioners who were given leave to withdraw were, Seth
Mendall, Wm. Ellis, Thomas Ellis, Eleazer Ellis, Barnabas
Ellis, Phineas Swift, Samuel Morris, Prince Wadsworth, Samuel
Gibbs and Catherine Swift. Another movement in favor
of a division was started in 1837, but when brought before the
town it was defeated by a vote of 376 to 246.</p>

<p>While the question of the division was pending in 1855 and
1856, I was chairman of the Board of Selectmen, and of course
was cognizant of all that was done to defeat the measure. In
those days the members of the legislature remained during the
week in Boston, or its immediate vicinity, only going home to
spend the Sabbath. The board invited them to make an excursion
to Plymouth on Fast Day, and entertained them at the
Samoset House. It is needless to say that the argument was
conclusive. A more difficult task awaited the board the next
year to oppose a petition to change the shire to Bridgewater.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
As soon as the legislature of 1857 came together, the board of
which I was still chairman, placed printed remonstrances in the
hands of reliable men in every town in the county, which poured
into the legislature bearing, I think, the names of a majority
of the voters of the county. A similar petition was sent to
the legislature at a time earlier than I can remember, headed
by Col. Sylvanus Lazell of Bridgewater, who unfamiliar with
the meaning of words, claimed that Plymouth had been a seaport
long enough, and that it was Bridgewater’s turn. At that
time a resolve was passed by the legislature requiring the submission
of two questions to the voters of the county: First,
are you in favor of a removal of the shire, and second, in what
town shall the shire be located. In answer to these questions
a majority voted for a removal, and singularly enough, a majority
also voted in favor of Plymouth for the location. With
the erection of a Court house in Brockton, and the erection of
a Registry in Plymouth, I think the crisis is passed, and that
no further attempts will be made to remove the shire. The increasing
population of Plymouth will serve to check the disturbance
of the equilibrium of the county, which the growth of
Brockton has heretofore caused.</p>

<p>The following professional men have not heretofore been
mentioned in these memories:</p>

<p>Dr. F. G. Oehme, a German homeopathic physician, came to
Plymouth about 1857, and occupied for a time the house on
Middle street, now owned by Charles H. Frink, and later
bought the house on Court street occupied in recent years by
George E. Morton. He had an office at one time in the second
story of the building on Main street, now occupied by H.
H. Cole. He sold his dwelling house in 1873 to Martha T.
Bartlett, the widow of Ephraim Bartlett, and removed to Long
Island, from thence going to Portland, Oregon, where he died
in 1905.</p>

<p>Dr. Ervin Webster, born in Vermont, January 25, 1828, came
to Plymouth in 1850, and established himself as a botanic physician
in the rooms on Main street, now occupied by Loring’s
watchmaker’s store. With his son, Olin E., four years of age,
he was drowned in Billington Sea, August 28, 1856.</p>

<p>Dr. George F. Wood, son of Isaac Lewis and Elizabeth
(Robbins) Wood, was born in Plymouth, March 12, 1841. He
married Sarah E., daughter of Sylvanus Harvey, and established
himself as a physician in an office on the North side of
Town Square. He died October 27, 1868.</p>

<p>Dr. Nathaniel Lothrop, son of Isaac and Priscilla (Thomas)
(Watson) Lothrop, was born in Plymouth in 1737, and graduated
at Harvard in 1756. He married first, Ellen, daughter
of Noah Hobart of Fairfield, Conn., and second, Lucy, daughter
of Abraham Hammatt of Plymouth, and died October 9,
1828.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Capen taught a private school in Plymouth in
1828, and in 1830 was practising medicine with an office in the
Marcy house, which stood on North street, where Dr. W. G.
Brown’s house stands. I do not know either the date or place
of his death.</p>

<p>Dr. Mercy B. Jackson, widow of Daniel Jackson, belonged to
the Homeopathic school and practiced in Plymouth and Boston,
and died in 1877.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Isaac LeBaron, known in my day as an apothecary, was
always called Doctor, but I do not know that he was educated
as a physician. He lived through my early youth in a house
standing on the upper corner of Leyden street and LeBaron
Alley, and had his shop in a one story building on Main street,
where Dr. Hubbard’s house now stands. At a later time he
lived in the house on the corner of North and Main streets, and
had his shop in the same building. He married in 1811 Mary
Doane of Boston, and died, January 29, 1849.</p>

<p>Dr. Parker came to Plymouth about 1882 and occupied for a
short time the house now owned by Arthur Lord, but whence
he came and where he went I do not know.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren Peirce succeeded Dr. Parker, and occupied the
same house until it was sold to Mr. Lord, when he moved to the
house at the lower angle of Carver street. He was born in
Tyngsboro, Mass., Nov. 30, 1840, and graduated at the Harvard
Medical School in 1869. He enlisted May 11, 1864, in
Co. K First Regiment of Heavy Artillery of Massachusetts,
and was appointed Hospital steward. After he received his
degree he practised some years in Boylston or West Boylston.
He was the son of Dr. Augustus and Alectia (Butterfield)
Peirce. His father was born in New Salem March 13, 1803,
and died in 1849. Dr. Warren Peirce died in Plymouth, July
10, 1898.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis B. Brewer had in 1850 an office at the corner of
Main and Middle streets, but I do not know whether he was
engaged in general practise or exclusively in that of dentistry.
He was succeeded in the same year by Dr. Robert D. Foster,
who advertised himself as having had “the most ample experience
in operative surgery, both in England and the United
States.”</p>

<p>In September, 1855, Dr. James L. Hunt occupied the office
which Dr. Brewer and Dr. Foster had occupied, but I know
neither his specialty nor the length of his service in Plymouth.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrew Mackie, son of Dr. Andrew of Wareham, was
born in 1799, and graduated at Brown in 1814. He came to
Plymouth in 1829, and lived on the corner of Market and Leyden
streets, and in the house next below the rooms of Mr. Beaman
on Middle street. He removed to New Bedford soon
after 1832.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Dr. John Flavel Gaylord, son of Ebenezer and Jane (Phelps)
Gaylord, was born in Amherst, Mass., March 22, 1852. He
fitted for college at the Hopkin’s Grammar school and graduated
at Yale in 1876. He took his degree from the Yale
Medical school in 1878, and completed his studies in 1879 and
1880 at the University of Berlin, and at Heilbronn. On his
return home he practised a few years in Cincinnati, and settled
in Plymouth in 1889, where he married Susan, daughter of
William Rider Drew, and died April 14, 1903.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles James Wood came to Plymouth in 1866 and settled
in Chiltonville. He was son of Leonard Wood, and was
born in Leicester, Mass., February 18, 1827, and was educated
at the Leicester Academy. He practised in Barre, Chiltonville,
Sandwich and Pocasset, in which latter place he died August
25, 1880. I remember him as attending with Dr. Alexander
Jackson in Manomet Ponds, the sailors who were wrecked
in the bark Velma in 1867. He was the father of General
Leonard Wood, now in the Philippines, who attended school in
Chiltonville.</p>

<p>Dr. John C. Bennett appeared in Plymouth in 1835, and advertised
himself an eclectic physician “formerly professor of
obstetric medicine and surgery.” The various medicines prepared
by him were claimed to be infallible ones for many diseases;
and of a tooth extractor invented by him, it was said by
an enthusiastic friend that it made the extraction of a tooth an
operation of pleasure instead of pain. He married Sally,
daughter of Job Rider of Plymouth, and lived and had his office
on Summer street. The introduction by him of the Plymouth
Rock breed of fowls gave him a reputation of a more substantial
character than his medicines. In 1842 he published “The
History of the Saints,” an expose of Joe Smith and Mormonism.</p>

<p>Dr. John Bachelder, son of John and Mary Bachelder, was
born in Mason, N. H., March 23, 1818, and graduated at Dartmouth
in 1841. He began to practice in Monument in 1844,
and married Martha Swift Keene of Sandwich, September 30,
1846, afterwards removing to Plymouth, where he died October
28, 1876.</p>

<p>Of Dr. Benjamin Hubbard I make an exception among the
living physicians, and include in these memories a notice due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
to his age and long practice in Plymouth. He was born in
Holden, Mass., November 25, 1817, the son of Benjamin and
Polly (Walker) Hubbard. He came to Plymouth in 1840 and
studied medicine with his brother, Dr. Levi Hubbard, and after
attending one term at the college at Woodstock, Vt., graduated
at the Pittsfield Medical college in 1844. After receiving
his degree he practiced six months in South Weymouth,
and then came to Plymouth, succeeding his brother, who removed
in the autumn of 1844 to New Bedford. Aside from
his practice he has been assiduous in his devotion to the welfare
of the Baptist Society, which owes him a debt which it gratefully
acknowledges, but can never repay. He married June
29, 1844, Ellen Maria, daughter of Elisha Perry of Sandwich,
and is enjoying in a serene old age the love and respect of the
community, whom for more than sixty years he has faithfully
served.</p>

<p>William Davis, son of Nathaniel Morton and Harriet Lazell
(Mitchell) Davis, was born in Plymouth May 12, 1818. He
fitted for college at the Boston Latin school, and graduated
at Harvard in 1837. He studied law with his father, and at
the Harvard Law school, and was admitted to the Suffolk bar
January 18, 1841. In those days it was the custom in the
Harvard Law school to hold a moot court once each winter for
which the jury was drawn from the senior class in college, and
lots were drawn among the senior law students for the positions
of senior and junior counsel on each side. William M.
Evarts was in the law school, and having come from Yale college
with a high reputation for eloquence, it was taken for
granted that if unsuccessful in the drawing, one of the successful
ones would surrender his place to him. Mr. Davis, one of
the successful ones, declined to give up his position as senior
counsel for the defendant, but a place was given to Mr. Evarts
as senior counsel for the plaintiff. As Mr. Davis lived in Boston
with his grandmother, he was little known by his fellow
students, and when the trial came on the lecture room of the
school was crowded with law students and undergraduates to
hear the eloquent man from Yale. I was one of the jury, and
I remember well the astonishment with which the masterly
speech of Mr. Davis was received. Some years afterwards
Mr. Richard H. Dana, who was a member of the law school at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
the time, told me that the unanimous verdict of the school was
that Mr. Davis was the star of the occasion. Mr. Evarts was
eloquent, but Mr. Davis possessed a grace of gesture and
speech which caused his hearers to ask who the man was who
had overmatched the eloquence of the man from Yale.</p>

<p>Mr. Evarts lost his eloquence as his practice at the bar increased,
and he became addicted to the use of long sentences,
which made his hearers wonder how he could escape from his
labyrinth of words without forgetting his nominative. He
said to a friend who criticized this defect in his rhetoric that in
his long experience at the bar the prisoner in the dock was the
only person who objected to long sentences. He was a man
of humor, and while secretary of state in the cabinet of President
Hayes, who never had wine on his table no matter who
were his guests, he said one day to a lady sitting next to him
at the state dinner, when the Roman punch was served—“Ah,
we have reached the life saving station.” The next day when
a friend asked him how the dinner went off he said, “Splendidly,
water flowed like champagne.”</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, Mr. Davis settled in Plymouth,
and was appointed in 1844 aide with the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel on the staff of Governor George N. Briggs, and in
1850, 1851 and 1852, was chairman of the Board of Selectmen.
From 1844 to 1852, he was Vice-President of the Pilgrim Society,
and from 1848 to 1850 inclusive, a Director of the Plymouth
Bank. He married December 2, 1849, Helen, daughter
of John and Deborah (Spooner) Russell, and had Harriet
Mitchell in September, 1850, who died in December, 1852, and
William, September 27, 1853. He died February 19, 1853.</p>

<p>William H. Whitman, son of Kilborn and Elizabeth (Winslow)
Whitman, was born in Pembroke, January 26, 1817. He
studied law with Thomas Prince Beal of Kingston, and began
practice in Bath, Maine, where his sister, Sarah Ann, the wife
of Benjamin Randall lived. He moved to Boston in 1844,
where he practiced law until 1851, a part of the time a partner
of Charles G. Davis. In 1851 he was appointed clerk of the
Courts of Plymouth County, and continued in office until his
death. He married in 1846, Ann Sever, daughter of William
and Sally W. Thomas, and had Isabella Thomas, Elizabeth H.
and William Thomas. He married second, Helen, widow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
Wm. Davis and daughter of John Russell, and had Russell,
Winslow and Ann Thomas. He died August 13, 1889.</p>

<p>Jedediah K. Hayward was born in Thetford, Vt., August
14, 1835, and graduated at Dartmouth College in 1859. He
studied law with Jesse E. Keith of Abington and Charles G.
Davis of Plymouth, and was admitted to the Plymouth bar
October 28, 1862. He practiced one year in Plymouth, then
two years in Boston, and finally moved to New York in 1865,
where he still lives.</p>

<p>William Harvey Spear came to Plymouth from Roxbury
about 1845 to teach the High School, and while teaching, studied
law. He was admitted to the Plymouth bar in 1848, and
continued business in Plymouth until his death. He married
May 1, 1831, Catherine Hinsdale, daughter of Nathan Allen of
Medfield and Dedham, but I find no record of his death.</p>

<p>William F. Spear, son of Wm. H. and Catherine H. (Allen)
Spear, was born in June, 1832, and was admitted to the Plymouth
bar in 1853. He married Caroline Augusta, daughter
of Elisha Whiting, and died in Plymouth, September 21, 1858.</p>

<p>There was an Edward L. Sherman practicing law in Plymouth
about fifty years ago, but I know nothing about him. He
may have been the Edward Lowell Sherman, a Harvard graduate
of 1854, who was admitted to the Essex bar in 1856, and
was practicing in Boston in 1860, and until his death in 1893.</p>

<p>Isaac Goodwin, son of William and Lydia Cushing (Sampson)
Goodwin, was born in Plymouth, June 28, 1786. He
studied law with Joshua Thomas, and began practice in Boston,
afterwards removing to Sterling, and in 1826 to Worcester.
In 1825 he published a book entitled “The Town Officer,” and
in 1830 another on the duties of a sheriff, which was followed
by a general history of Worcester County, written for the Worcester
Magazine. At the 150th anniversary of the destruction
of the town of Lancaster he delivered the oration. He married
in 1810, Eliza, daughter of Abraham Hammatt, and had
Lucy Lothrop, 1811, Elizabeth Mason 1813, Wm. Hammatt,
1817, John Emery, 1820, John Abbot, 1824, Mary Jane, 1834,
who married Loring Henry Austin of Boston, and was the well
known authoress. He died September 10, 1832.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Joseph Sylvester Clark, son of Seth and Mary
(Tupper) Clark, was born in Manomet Ponds, December 19,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
1800. Dr. Clark was born in a house nearly opposite the residence
of the late Horace B. Taylor. His brother Israel, one
of the purest of men, was on the board of selectmen with me
in 1855, and lived at the time in the old homestead.</p>

<p>In 1818 Rev. Seth Stetson, the pastor of the Manomet
church, became Unitarian, and in the temporary division of the
church which followed, Dr. Clark’s father was one of Mr. Stetson’s
followers. As late as 1819 it seems to be certain that
the son had not been able to believe in the divinity of Christ,
and he did not become a member of the church until June 9,
1822, after which time he was a member in full standing of the
Orthodox Congregational church. At the age of seventeen
Dr. Clark taught school in Manomet, and soon after in Hingham,
and by his earnings as a teacher and the moderate assistance
which his father could afford to render, he was enabled to
enter the classical academy at Amherst on the 29th of July,
1822, and to enter Amherst college in September, 1823, where
he graduated in due course with valedictory honors. In 1827,
after a short service as tutor at Amherst, he entered the Andover
theological seminary, and after intervals spent in teaching
school, graduated in 1831. On the second of October,
1831, he preached at Sturbridge, Mass., and on the twenty-seventh
was unanimously invited to become the successor of
Rev. Alvan Bond in that town. His ordination followed on the
twenty-first of December. On the twenty-eighth of May, 1839,
he was appointed secretary of the Massachusetts Missionary
Society, and severing his connection with the Sturbridge parish,
he entered on the discharge of the duties of secretary continuing
them until his resignation on the twenty-third of September,
1857. In 1858 he published “A Historical sketch of the
Congregational churches of Massachusetts from 1620 to 1858.”
Dr. Park said of him “his experience in the Home Missionary
work convinced him that Congregationalists had sacrificed the
spiritual welfare of their own churches to an ill-regarded zeal
for harmony with other denominations. They had cultivated
such a dread of sectarianism as induced them to abandon their
own distinctive principles for the sake of living in peace with
sectarians who became the more exclusive as Congregationalists
became the more liberal.”</p>

<p>At the time of the formation of the Congregational Library<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Association, he was chosen its Corresponding Secretary in
May, 1853, and its financial agent in June, 1857, and soon after
united with Rev. H. M. Dexter, and Rev. A. H. Quint, in publishing
the Congregational quarterly, the first number of which
was issued in January, 1859. To his unremitting labors was
largely due the consummation of the project to buy for the
Association the Crowninshield building, which it long occupied
on the corner of Beacon and Somerset streets in Boston. In
1851 he received from his Alma Mater the degree of Doctor of
Divinity, and in 1852 was chosen a trustee of the college. He
married December 27, 1831, Harriet B., daughter of Joseph
Bourne of New Bedford, and died at the home of his brothers,
Israel and Nathaniel, at Manomet, August 17, 1861.</p>

<p>Rev. Ezra Shaw Goodwin, son of General Nathaniel and
Ruth (Shaw) Goodwin, was born in Plymouth in 1787, and
was settled as pastor of the first church in Sandwich. He
married Ellen Watson, daughter of John Davis, and died in
Sandwich, February 5, 1833.</p>

<p>Rev. Hersey Bradford Goodwin, son of William and Lydia
Cushing (Sampson) Goodwin, was born in Plymouth, and
graduated at Harvard in 1826. He graduated at the Harvard
Divinity school in 1829, and was settled in Concord. He
married in 1830, Lucretia Ann, daughter of Benjamin Marston
Watson of Plymouth, and had Wm. Watson, 1831. He
married second, Amelia Mackie of Boston, and had Amelia
and Hersey Bradford, and died in 1836.</p>

<p>Rev. Thomas Weston, son of Coomer and Hannah (Doten)
Weston, was born in Plymouth, August 30, 1821. He prepared
for the ministry at the Meadville school in Pennsylvania,
and was settled at various times over Unitarian societies in
Northumberland, Penn., Bernardston and New Salem, Mass.,
Farmington, Maine, and Barnstable and Stowe, Mass. He
married April 29, 1852 Lucinda, daughter of Ralph Cushman
of Bernardston, and died in Greenfield, Mass., March 29, 1904.</p>

<p>Rev. James Augustus Kendall, son of Rev. Dr. James and
Sarah (Poor) Kendall, was born in Plymouth, Nov. 1, 1803,
and graduated at Harvard in 1823. He was settled in Medfield
six years, and after spending a short time in Stowe and Cambridge,
he removed to Framingham, where he married May 29,
1833, Maria B., daughter of Col. James Brown, and died May
16, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>Rev. Sylvester Holmes, son of Sylvester and Grace (Clark)
Holmes, was born in Manomet Ponds April 6, 1788, and was
ordained as minister in 1811. He was for many years engaged
in the service of the American Bible Society, especially in the
South, where he was everywhere known among leading men
of both church and state. From 1861, until 1866, he was settled
over the church at Manomet Ponds, where he married in
1810 Esther Holmes. He married a second wife, Fanny Kingman
of Bridgewater, and died in New Bedford at the house of
Ivory H. Bartlett, November 27, 1866.</p>

<p>Rev. William Faunce, son of Solomon and Eleanor (Bradford)
Faunce, was born in Plymouth about 1815. In 1840 he
organized a Christian Baptist Society, and built a meeting
house near the Russell Mills. After a long pastorate he removed
to Mattapoisett, where he died about ten years ago. He
married Matilda, daughter of Josiah Bradford, and had Matilda
B., 1835, who married Weston C. Vaughan, William,
1837, and Ellen, 1840.</p>

<p>Rev. Lewis Holmes, son of Peter and Sally (Harlow)
Holmes, was born in Plymouth, April 12, 1813, and graduated
at Colby University. He had settlements at various times
over Baptist Societies in Edgartown, Scituate, Leicester and
other places. He married Lydia K., daughter of Pickels Cushing
of Norwell, and died May 24, 1887.</p>

<p>Rev. Russell Tomlinson, son of David and Polly (Sherman)
Tomlinson was born in Newtown, Conn., October 1, 1808, and
after fitting for the ministry was settled pastor over a Universalist
Society in Buffalo, N. Y. In September, 1838 he
came to Plymouth, where he was settled in May, 1839, pastor
of the Universalist church as the successor of Rev. Albert Case.
In 1867 he resigned his pastorate, continuing to live in Plymouth
until his death, and devoting himself to the practice of
homeopathy, and the advocacy of the cause of temperance.
He married Harriet W., daughter of Charles and Mary Ann
(Williams) May, and died March 4, 1878.</p>

<p>Rev. George Ware Briggs, son of William and Sally (Palmer)
Briggs, was born in Little Compton, April 8, 1810, and
graduated at Brown University in 1825. He graduated at
the Harvard Divinity school in 1834, and was soon after settled
in Fall River. In 1838 he was installed colleague pastor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
of Rev. Dr. Jas. Kendall of the First Church in Plymouth, continuing
in that pastorate until 1852. January 6, 1853, he became
pastor of the First Church in Salem. On the first of
April, 1867, he resigned the Salem pastorate, and in that year
became pastor of the Third Congregational Church in Cambridge,
located in Cambridge Port, where he remained until his
death, having a colleague in his later years. He married first
Lucretia Archbald, daughter of Abner Bartlett, and second
in 1849, Lucia J., daughter of Nathaniel Russell of Plymouth.
He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from
Harvard in 1855, and died in Plymouth, September 10, 1895.</p>

<p>Rev. Daniel F. Goddard, son of Daniel and Polly (Finney)
Goddard, was born in Plymouth about 1828, and married in
1854 Mary E., daughter of Ellis Barnes. He studied for the
ministry, and was settled in various places, including, I think,
Harvard and Weymouth. He died in 1883.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Daniel Worcester Faunce, son of Peleg and Olive
(Finney) Faunce, was born in Plymouth, January 3, 1829, and
graduated at Amherst in 1850. He studied for the ministry
at the Newton Theological Institute, and was ordained in
1853. He married, August 15, 1853, Mary P. Perry, and in
1871 Mary E. Tucker. He was settled in Washington, D. C.,
and Pawtucket, R. I., and was the author of a number of religious
works. His home is now in Providence, near that of
his son, Rev. Wm. Herbert Perry Faunce, President of Brown
University.</p>

<p>Mention of Plymouth grave yards has been confined thus far
to a slight allusion to Cole’s Hill. Of the many within the
limits of the town two are burial places of the aborigines,
Watson’s Hill and High Cliff, and the numerous skeletons exhumed
at those places from time to time, make it conclusive
that they were places set apart for the burial of the dead. The
grounds in and about the central town have been thoroughly
explored in laying out streets, in excavating cellars and digging
trenches for water, gas and sewer pipes, and not enough Indian
bones have been found to warrant the conclusion that any other
burial places were used by the Indians than those above mentioned.
The discovery of the burial ground at High Cliff was
brought to my knowledge by an incident in my own experience.
I met one day in the autumn of 1844 on Court street a little
girl about six years of age, crying and bleeding at the mouth.
An older girl leading her told me that she had a pin in her
throat. I led her to her home on South Russell street, stopping
on the way at Mr. Standish’s blacksmith shop to borrow
a pair of pincers, and soon relieved her from her suffering.
The next day Mr. Orin Bosworth, learning that I was his little
daughter’s friend, gave me as a reward for my service a stone
pipe, which he said a gang of laborers, of whom he was foreman,
had found in the railroad cut at High Cliff. I visited
the spot at once, and found that seven or eight skeletons had
been found, indicating an extensive burial ground, undoubtedly
antedating the days of the Pilgrims. Some years afterwards,
after the establishment of the Agassiz Museum in Cambridge,
the pipe was examined by the experts of the Museum and
pronounced of European workmanship, probably brought over
and given to the Indians, either by European fishermen, or
by one of the early adventurers like Champlain, John Smith
or Thomas Dermer. It is made of stone about eight inches
long, with a bowl about an inch square, and is in perfect order.
I have quite recently seen a drawing of a fragment of a similar
pipe which was found between the floor timbers of the Sparrow-hawk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
wrecked on Cape Cod in 1626, the timbers of which
have been put together, and are now in Pilgrim Hall. The
burial ground in question owes its escape from forgetfulness
to the pin in the throat of little Hannah Elizabeth Bosworth.</p>

<p>Passing by Burial Hill and Cole’s Hill to be mentioned later,
there are Oak Grove and Vine Hills cemeteries; the Catholic
cemetery; two burial grounds in Chiltonville, one at Bramhall’s
corner, and one at the Russell Mills meeting house;
three at Manomet, one where the first meeting house stood not
far from the residence of the late Horace B. Taylor, one at
the present meeting house, a modern Indian burial ground,
on an Indian reservation on the westerly side of Fresh Pond;
one at South Ponds, near the Chapel; one at the head of Half
Way Ponds; one at the head of Long Pond; one near Bloody
Pond, and one at Cedarville. There are also burial places in
the South part of the town, which have been devoted to family
uses and single graves may be found near Hospital landing
at Billington Sea, and on the South Pond road, where
the old pest house stood. At the last place there is a headstone
at the grave of Mary, wife of Thomas Mayhew, who
died September 3, 1776, aged 54 years. She was a daughter
of Thomas Witherell, and as her husband was one of the most
prominent men in the town, it is probable that she died of small
pox, and that the removal of her body to a grave among her
deceased relatives was thought dangerous.</p>

<p>I take the liberty to suggest that the selectmen set up a
bronze tablet in the Indian burial ground at Fresh Pond with
the following inscription, including an extract from a poem
by the Rev. Theodore Dwight;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center no-indent fs80">“Indian Burial Ground.”</p>

<p class="fs80">“This tablet is erected in memory of the Indian tribes whose extinction,
beginning in the Plymouth Colony, is now almost complete.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Indulge my native land, indulge a tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That steals impassioned o’er a nation’s doom;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And sorrows fall on an Indian’s tomb.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With regard to Cole’s Hill, the impression has prevailed
that burials there were confined to the winter of 1620 and
1621. After a somewhat thorough examination of evidence
and probabilities, I have reached the conclusion that this impression
is not correct. I have already stated that no record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
exists of the discovery of the remains of white men except on
Cole’s and Burial Hill. Pretty thorough explorations beneath
the surface of the ground, in or near the main town settlement,
prove with reasonable certainty that one of these two
places was during the early years of the Plymouth Colony the
place of burial. It is an interesting fact that the Pilgrims,
unlike the Puritans, followed the English custom of burying
their dead in the church yard, a spot as near as possible to
their place of worship. In Duxbury the first meeting house
was built near the shore, not far from the base of Captain’s
Hill, and the first burials were made immediately about it. In
Marshfield the first meeting house was built near the tomb
of Daniel Webster, and what is called the Winslow burial
ground, which incloses that tomb, was the church yard. There
is every reason to believe that the same custom prevailed in
Plymouth. The Common house was for many years used for
public worship, except in times of impending dangers when
resort was temporarily had to the fort, on what is now Burial
Hill, and Cole’s Hill, sloping down to that house lying directly
at its base was the church yard. As long then as the Common
House was the place of public worship, I cannot doubt
that Cole’s Hill was the burial place, and that when the first
meeting house was built on the North side of Town Square,
Burial Hill sloping down to its walls, became the church yard
and the place for depositing the bodies of the dead.</p>

<p>In this view of the case it becomes important, in deciding
when burials ceased to be made on Cole’s Hill, to ascertain
when the first meeting house proper was built. Upon this
question there has been a difference of opinion, some writers
saying 1637, and some 1647. Those fixing the time at 1647
have based their opinion, so far as I can discover, on the historic
record that the town meeting held in May, 1649 was held
in the meeting house, and on the fact that the meeting house
was then for the first time mentioned as the place for holding
town meetings. The meeting held on the 10th of July, 1638, is
recorded as having been held in the Governor’s house, and it is
asked by the advocates of the later date why should that meeting
have been held in the Governor’s house if the meeting
house was built in 1637. It must be remembered that the purpose
of the meeting house was not to furnish a place for civic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
meetings, but a place for religious worship, and that only the
increasing numbers of the settlement in 1649 outgrew the
capacity of the Governor’s house, and rendered the use of
the meeting house at that time one of necessity. And again
it must be remembered that with the single exception of
the meeting, July 16, 1638, no meeting place is mentioned until
May 17, 1649, and for all that is known to the contrary, meeting
after meeting before 1649 may have been held in the meeting
house without any record of the meeting place. Mr. Goodwin
in a foot note on page 231 of the “Pilgrim Republic,”
makes it appear that the record states that the meeting of May
17, 1649, was held in the <em>new</em> meeting house, but the word
(new) is not in the record, and therefore adds no weight to
the argument in support of the date of 1647. The question
may be pertinently asked, “Why, if the meeting house was
built in 1647 was its occupation for town meetings delayed
until May 17, 1649?” and this question is as difficult to answer
as the other, “Why was it not earlier devoted to civic uses if it
was built in 1637.”</p>

<p>The probabilities in favor of 1637 are too strong to be
overcome. Until 1636, after the settlement of Duxbury was
made, it was a mooted question whether the meeting house
should not be built in some place midway between the two settlements.
A decision was reached in that year, and at once the
meeting house in Duxbury was built in 1637, making it probable
that Plymouth followed and built its meeting house in the
same year. It would be a severe reflection on the religious
spirit and enterprise of the Plymouth people to suppose that
Duxbury built its house of worship in 1637, and Marshfield in
1641, while the erection of the meeting house of the parent
church of which Wm. Brewster was the Elder, was delayed
ten years longer.</p>

<p>But we are not left alone to probabilities. In the will of
William Palmer, executed in November, 1637, and probated
in the following March, is a clause providing for the payment
“of somewhat to the meeting house in Plymouth.”</p>

<p>Thus then in my opinion Burial Hill became the church yard
in 1637. It retained its name of Fort Hill many years, and
under that name extended across what is now Russell street
along the rear of the estates on the west side of Court street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
At a town meeting held on the 14th of May, 1711, it was
voted to sell “all the common lands about the fort hills reserving
sufficient room for a burying place.” From that time
Burial Hill has remained practically within its present limits.
But it is asked why is the headstone of Edward Gray bearing
the date of 1681 the oldest stone on the hill. The answer is
to be found first in the undoubted fact that for many years it
was not the custom to mark the graves with stones, and second,
in the depredations to which stones were subjected by neglect
and rough usage. In the early days of the Colony slate
stone was not found within accessible distances, and when they
were finally imported from England, their cost undoubtedly
precluded their general use. Many of those imported were
creased and opened to the weather, and finally were disintegrated
by frost and broken up. I, myself, by the permission
of the selectmen, and of course at the cost of the town, devised
a kind of hood made of galvanized iron with which I have
protected seventy or more from both the influence of frost and
the no less destructive invasions of relic hunting vandals. So
far as neglect of the hill is concerned, I can find no suggestion
in the records of any proposition to protect the hill until
1757, when it was voted to fence it. Nothing was done, however,
until 1782, when it was voted to permit Rev. Chandler
Robbins to fence and pasture it with the right at any time to
remove the fence and possess it as his own. Then for the first
time the hill was fenced, and Mrs. Robbins, after the death of
her husband petitioned the town to buy the fence. In 1800 it
was voted to permit Rev. Dr. Kendall to pasture the hill and
build a fence on condition that no horses be permitted within
the inclosure. Before that time it is evident that horses were
permitted to pasture it, and the treatment to which the stones
were thus exposed, is easily imagined. In later times, decayed
and fallen stones have been piled up behind the hearse house,
where masons in want of covering stones have taken them at
their pleasure. Of late years, however, the hill has had better
treatment, and the stones which have fallen have been reset at
the expense of the town. It is unnecessary to say that the most
vigilant care on the part of the town should be used, for
aside from all sentimental reasons, and aside from the duty of
the town to realize that it holds the hill in trust for all our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
country, the hill and its stones form a commercial asset of incalculable
value. An attempt was made in 1819 to plant ornamental
trees on the hill, but either nothing was done, or the
attempt to carry out the vote of the town proved a failure. In
1843 another more successful attempt was made, and a large
number of trees were planted, and the duty of keeping them
well watered was assigned to the scholars in the High school.
Many of these survived, and others have at various times been
added.</p>

<p>Among the conclusions to which I have been led by the
foregoing review, is this, that Elder Brewster, Governor Bradford
and John Howland, and the other Mayflower passengers
who died in Plymouth after 1637, were buried on Burial Hill.
With regard to the burial of the Elder, I am obliged to reverse
the opinion heretofore expressed by me, that he was buried in
Duxbury. There are on record two inventories of the property
of Brewster, one of his house and its contents in Duxbury,
and the other of his house and its contents in Plymouth.
The contents of the former are so meagre and unimportant as
to make it certain that the Duxbury house was only an occasional
residence, while those of the latter, consisting of clothing
and a full household equipment, prove that he died in
Plymouth, and that there was his permanent home. Besides
Brewster was the Elder of Plymouth church, and of course
lived among his people, and further, Bradford says in his history,
that Mrs. Brewster died before 1627, before the Duxbury
settlement began, and of course was buried in Plymouth, near
whose grave the Elder would have sought for himself a final
resting place.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on the gravestones, though not quaint, are
interesting to others besides the antiquary, and a few of them
I shall include in this chapter without either alphabetical or
chronological order as follows:</p>

<p>“Priscilla Cotton, widow of Josiah Cotton, born September
30, 1860, died October 4, 1859.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cotton lived and died in a house which was removed
when Brewster street was opened, and now stands on the
North side of that street. She told me that at the time of the
Boston tea party in 1773 she attended a boarding school a little
below the Old South Meeting house, and remembered some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
the incidents attending the destruction of the tea. A man servant
brought home some of the tea, but some of the scholars
refused to drink it. After her husband’s death in 1819, she
bought an annuity at the office of the Massachusetts Hospital
Life Insurance Company, which after forty years of payment
was terminated, much to the satisfaction of the company.</p>

</div>


<p>During my youth, public entertainments were rare in Plymouth,
especially in the winter. During that season, with
unlighted streets and the houses lighted for the most
part with oil lamps, the town, more particularly in a storm of
rain or snow was gloomy, indeed. Families gathered around
their wood fires and here and there groups of men would sit
on the counters and boxes in the stores until the nine o’clock
bell called them home. When any of the housewives ventured
to have a party, candles with their candlesticks and snuffers
were brought out and scattered about the parlors on mantels
and tables. Occasionally instead of a formal evening party
a lap tea was the entertainment, the guests arriving at half
past six or seven. Those lap teas were glorious times for us
boys, for there was something exciting in the preparation. An
extra supply of cream was to be bought, the sugar loaf was to
be divested of its blue cartridge paper covering, and
chopped into squares, and sandwiches and whips and custards
were to be made, of which we were sure to get preliminary
tastes. And better than all we were permitted to carry around
waiters loaded with cups of tea and plates and cream and
sugar, and the various articles of food.</p>

<p>Music at these entertainments was uncommon. There were
as long ago as about 1828 or 1830 only four pianos in town,
and these were owned by Mrs. Pelham W. Warren, Mrs. Nathaniel
Russell, Jr., Miss Eliza Ann Bartlett and my sister Rebecca.
My sister’s was given as part pay for a Chickering
piano; Miss Bartlett’s was sold to Joseph Holmes of Kingston
and is now owned by his granddaughter, Mrs. H. M. Jones of
that town; Mrs. Russell’s is still owned by her daughter, Mrs.
Wm. Hedge, and Mrs. Warren’s went I know not where. The
Russell piano is, as I remember the others were, of mahogany,
ornamented with brass and with a scale of five and a
half octaves. It was made by Alfred Babcock of Philadelphia,
probably before 1825, for R. Mackey of Boston, who was not
a manufacturer, but probably an agent for the maker. I say
that it was probably made before 1825, because it is stated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
histories of piano making that Mr. Babcock invented in that
year the iron string board, which this one does not have.</p>

<p>At a party in a house where either of the above pianos was
owned, one of the guests, probably a visitor from Boston,
favored the guests, by request, with a song. I recall one occasion
when a lady was invited to sing who was unable to pronounce
the letter “s.” She unhesitatingly consented, and taking
her seat at the piano sang the song beginning with the words,
“Oh ting tweet bird, oh ting.” Though more than sixty years
have elapsed I am often reminded when I hear a lady sing at
the piano of the polite invitation of that lady to the tweet bird
to ting.</p>

<p>Aside from the parties the entertainments were chiefly lectures
by Rev. Chas. W. Upham on “Witchcraft;” by Rev. Chas.
T. Brooks on, “Education in Germany,” by Mr. Emerson on
“Socrates;” or lectures by other prominent men; exhibitions
of ledgerdemain by Potter or Harrington, or of a mummy
which walked “in Thebes’ streets three thousand years ago”;
or if nothing better offered an evening book auction. Occasionally
a debating society would be formed of which Timothy
Berry was always the organizer and patron, a man always
ready to encourage the oratorical efforts of young men. I was
permitted as a boy to attend the meetings of the society, and
I remember the debaters well. As young as I was
I could not help being amused at the seriousness with which
the grandest subjects were attacked as if then and there their
settlement depended on the merits of the debate. There was
one gentleman who every evening, when the nine o’clock bell
rang, rose impressively and said, “Mister President, many
subjects not been teched on to-night, move we journ.” The
club accordingly adjourned, and the impressive gentleman left
the hall, evidently feeling that he had been an active participant
in the debate.</p>

<p>There was another society in my boyhood called the Plymouth
Madan Society, but from whom it derived its name I
never knew. It was a musical society, and occasionally gave
concerts. The nearest approximation to the name I ever knew
until recently, was the Scripture name of Medan, the son of
Abraham. But that was evidently a misfit. I next found
among the proper names in the Century dictionary, that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
Martin Madan, an English Methodist divine who published in
1780 a book called Telyphthora, advocating polygamy. But
as the Plymouth Madan Society gave concerts in the Universalist
church, it is not probable that it was named in honor of
a polygamist. Having since met with the name of Madan in
the newspapers of a family in Marshfield, I wrote to Lot J.
Madan, living at Green Harbor, asking him if any of his family
in past generations, either his father or grandfather, had
been musical. Mistaking my word musical for married, he
replied that if his father and grandfather had not been married
he would not have been around in these days. In a subsequent
letter he said he played on the violin, and was as far
as he knew the only musician in the family. For whom then
the society was named is a question still unsolved.</p>

<p>Among other societies within my day was one to aid in arresting
horse thieves, and that was one of many formed in
various towns. The only surviving one within my knowledge
is in Dedham, which annually meets and elects its officers. I
have already alluded in another chapter to a temperance society
which was formed in 1832, by whose efforts more was
done to promote temperance than by all other agencies combined
from that time to this. The sale of intoxicating liquors
was almost completely stopped, the family use of wines
was abandoned, and under the influence of Daniel Frost, whose
addresses were largely attended, more than a thousand names
were secured to pledges to abstain from the use of ardent
spirits.</p>

<p>An Anti-slavery society I have also referred to which was
formed in the Robinson church on the evening of the Fourth
of July, 1835, and occupied for some years rooms in the second
story of the northerly end of the building which up to
1883 stood on the site of the Sherman block on the west side
of Main street. The seed of anti-slavery fell in Plymouth on
sandy soil, but watered by heavenly dew, it soon took root and
broke through the conservative crust which under the influence
of the commercial and financial interests of the town, for a
time obstructed its growth.</p>

<p>There was a peace society formed in 1831, but as we were
then at peace with the world, there does not appear to have
been at that time any special call for the organization. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
seems to have been a fashion of the times to form peace societies,
but their influence was not sufficiently enduring to
check the movements which resulted in the Mexican war not
many years later. But it seems to be the way of our
people to advocate peace in a time of peace, and when war
threatens, to advocate war. The President of a Massachusetts
Sunday-school Association preached in peaceful years as
a minister of the gospel peace on earth and good will among
men, but in 1898 I saw him marching with the first battery in
all the panoply of war to join the murderers of his fellow
men. Another prominent minister of the gospel who, when no
war clouds darkened the horizon, permitted himself without
protest to be called the apostle of peace, was as dumb as an
oyster when the opportunity came to utter trumpet-tongued his
protests against the war.</p>

<p>Bu it was not always so with the people of Plymouth. Ever
after the close of the revolution they were advocates of peace,
and when the war with Great Britain broke out in 1812 they
uttered in no uncertain language their determined protest. A
memorial to the President denouncing the war was passed
unanimously in town meeting, the closing words of which
were as follows: “Thus sir, with much brevity, but with a
frankness which the magnitude of the occasion demands, they
have expressed their honest sentiments upon the existing offensive
war against Great Britain, a war by which their dearest
interests as men and Christians are deeply affected, and in
which they deliberately declare, as they cannot conscientiously,
so they will not have any voluntary participation. They make
this declaration with that paramount regard to their civil and
religious obligations which becomes the disciples of the prince
of peace whose kingdom is not of this world, and before
whose impartial tribunal presidents and kings will be upon a
level with the meanest of their fellowmen, and will be responsible
for all the blood they shed in wanton and unnecessary
war.”</p>

<p>My only comment on the above memorial is that milder
language was flippantly denounced as treasonable by some of
the advocates of the recent war with Spain.</p>

<p>The various societies which I have thus far mentioned were
temporary in their character, and had short careers. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
were, however, two others formed in the first quarter of the
last century, one charitable and the other historical, which have
continued to this day, and having been incorporated, will continue
for an indefinite period. One of these, the Pilgrim Society,
will be noticed in a later chapter in connection with the
celebrations of the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims.
The other, the Plymouth Fragment Society, having its origin
and inspiration in the heart of a benevolent lady a native of a
foreign land, with whom the ladies of Plymouth enthusiastically
co-operated, has year after year for nearly ninety years, by
the kindly hands of each succeeding generation, dispensed
among the suffering poor a charity which, dropping like the
gentle rain from heaven, is twice blessed, for it blesseth him that
gives, and him that takes. It was founded by Madame Marie
de Verdier Turner on the 13th of February, 1818, for the
declared purpose of “relieving the wants of the destitute poor.”
To meet legal requirements imposed by bequests to the Society,
it was incorporated March 14, 1877, with a capital not
estimated nor divided into shares.</p>

<p>The officers of the Society since its organization have been as
follows: Presidents, Mary Warren, Martha Russell, Joanna
Davis, Betsey F. Russell, Margaret Warren, Sarah M. Holmes,
Laura Russell, Martha Ann Morton, Caroline B. Warren,
Esther Bartlett. Vice-presidents: Esther Parsons Hammatt,
Betsey Torrey, Elizabeth Freeman, Lucretia B. Watson, Rebecca
D. Parker, Mrs. Thomas, Sally Stephens, Mercy B.
Lovell, Ellen M. Hubbard, Helen Russell. Secretaries: Betsey
H. Hodge, Rebecca Bartlett, Elizabeth L. Loud, Abby M. Hall,
Helen Russell, Jennie S. Hubbard. Treasurers: Francis L.
Jackson, Phebe Cotton, Mary Ann Stevenson, Eunice D. Robbins,
Caroline E. Gilbert, Lydia G. Locke, Elizabeth W.
Whitman. The amount expended in charity during the year
ending October 1, 1905, has been $883.93 for food, fuel and
clothing, and $360 in payments of $2 a month to eleven regular,
and four special pensioners.</p>

<p>So little is known by the present generation of Madame
Turner, the founder of the Society, and of her romantic life
that I present to my readers a short sketch of her career for the
facts in which I am chiefly indebted to a paper read by Lois B.
Brewster as a graduating exercise in 1899, at the Plymouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
High school, the language of which I have in a measure adopted:</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner was a native of Sweden, born in Malmo in 1789.
Her father was a retired officer in the Hussars, an accomplished
gentleman, and her mother was connected with noble families
from whom she inherited the prejudices of the aristocracy.
She received an education which beside the ordinary branches
taught in the schools, included music, embroidery and painting.
Her father died when she was fifteen years of age, leaving her
mother with only a little more than a government pension for
her support. After removing with her family to Copenhagen,
Madame de Verdier soon after died, never having recovered
from the shock caused by the death of her husband. Marie
became an inmate of the home of a rich merchant, who provided
her with every luxury, and in whose house she often met
guests of the merchant from foreign lands. Among these
guests at dinner one day were Captain Robinson, an Englishman,
and Captain Lothrop Turner of Plymouth, ship masters,
whose ships were consigned to their host. It is needless
to say that the handsome Captain Turner and the pretty
Swedish maid fell deeply in love with each other before his
ship was ready to leave, but as she could speak no English, and
Swedish was to him an unknown tongue, their language of love
was carried on by the tell tale eye and blushing cheek, except
when Robinson lent his services as an interpreter. Marie,
against the advice of her friends, yielded to the influence
of her own head, and accepting his hand in marriage, the husband
and wife after a marriage solemnized in April, 1812, sailed
for her new home in New England. It was during the war
of 1812, and in entering Massachusetts Bay, Capt. Turner barely
escaped capture by an English frigate patrolling the coast,
but finally reached Plymouth. The story of the romantic marriage
had reached Plymouth before them, and on the day of
their arrival the young friends of the captain were gathered
to give a cordial welcome to his Swedish bride. Long before
the arrival of the stage bearing them was due, numbers
of women and children anxious to see the bride gathered on
Cole’s Hill, and from that vantage ground saw the blue-eyed,
golden haired little woman as she dismounted and entered
the house of Capt. Turner’s father, which stood near the foot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
and on the South side of Leyden street. It was a trying
season for her among new friends whom she had never seen,
imperfect in the use of the English tongue, and amid scenes
to which she must become accustomed, as those of home.
Not long after her arrival a daughter Maria was born, who
died in infancy.</p>

<p>It now became her task to learn the language which she
must make her own, but she was an apt scholar, and bravely
and speedily fought her way through its intricate words and
phrases. As she became acquainted with Plymouth people
she was surprised that the pupils in school were not taught to
paint and embroider, and as two sisters of her husband were
teaching a private school she engaged in the instruction of their
pupils in those accomplishments. She also formed classes of
girls, and taught them music, besides painting and needlework.
In her visits among the sick she came to realize the needy condition
of many families suffering from the effects of the embargo,
which were added to the sad conditions of the revolution
from which they had not yet recovered. Throughout the
early years of her life in Plymouth, she worked with zeal in
enlisting the aid and sympathy of those in comfortable circumstances
in charitable work, and while engaged personally in
visits among the poor she conceived the idea of associated work
in aid of the sick and destitute.</p>

<p>Her husband died in Havana, April 28, 1824, and she was
left with little means of support, except that derived from
her own labors. Friends in Boston offered her aid which she
refused, believing it inconsistent with the character of a true
American to accept assistance while able to support herself.</p>

<p>She opened a school in the house of a friend on Fort Hill in
Boston, but after a short time felt a longing to return to her
native land, and sailed for Sweden in a vessel owned by Capt.
John Russell. She found, however, her country not as she
had left it, rich and moral, but a decaying monarchy, its people
intemperate, and without the political freedom enjoyed in
America. She lived for a time in Stockholm as a friend of
Countess Ferson, and there received an advantageous offer of
marriage, which she declined, saying, “I have been the wife of
a free citizen, I will not lower myself by marrying a subject.”
One day while riding with the Countess, she saw a ship flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
an American flag, and exclaiming—“See the stars—see the
stars,” told the Countess that she must return in that ship to
her adopted country. And this she did, declaring that she
preferred a home of poverty in a free country to an abode of
luxury under a monarchy.</p>

<p>Arriving in Boston in delicate health, with symptoms of pulmonary
disease, after a season of suffering, she removed to
New York, hearing of a place there where she could teach. Her
disease, however, increasing, she went south, where she spent
two years with friends, engaged in finishing a translation of
“Waldermar, the Victorious,” from the Danish of Ingerman,
which she had begun while on her last voyage.</p>

<p>She had previously published with great success a work on
“Drawing and Shadowing Flowers,” with lithographic plates,
executed by herself, and “The Young Ladies’ Assistant in
Drawing and Painting,” and several stories for magazines. She
returned to Boston in 1837, with the hope of continuing literary
work, but her disease increasing, she was obliged to abandon
the publication of her book, and told her friends that if it should
be published after her death, she hoped that a sketch of her life
might be prefixed, for she “believed that it would make the
women of America more sensible of the inestimable value of
their free institutions; more thankful for their religious privileges,
and more American, when they read her story. I would
do something for the country where I have found a Saviour for
my soul, where I have had a home, and where I shall have a
grave.” She died at the Massachusetts General Hospital,
March 15, 1838, and her body was removed to Plymouth and
buried in Oak Grove cemetery. Her life and work should be
remembered by something more enduring than an occasional
allusion, and I suggest that a stone be erected over her grave
with something like the following inscription:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>I have said in an early chapter that after having attended
Ma’am Weston’s school on North street, Mrs. Maynard’s in the
second story room in the building on the corner of Main street
and Town Square, and Mr. George P. Bradford’s school in a
second story room on the opposite corner of Main street, I entered
the high school in 1832. The high school house was
situated on the north side of the Unitarian church between
School street and the town tombs, and was a one story building
about forty-five feet long and twenty or twenty-five feet wide,
with a door on the southerly end.</p>

<p>The situation of the house recalls these lines of Whittier:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The town ne’er heeds the sceptic’s hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While near her school the church tower stands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor fears the bigot’s blinding rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While near the church tower stands the school.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Standing on sloping ground the foundation of the house on
the street side was high enough to admit of a cellar above the
street level. In the northerly end of the school room there
was a platform, two steps above the main floor, with the teacher’s
area in the centre flanked on each side by three unpainted
pine desks with lids, and with long seats to correspond, facing
the area. An alley led from the door to the platform with a
row of desks and seats on each side, the row on the east side being
broken by a space for a box stove for burning wood, the
only fuel at that time used.</p>

<p>The house was built in 1770, and until 1826 was called the
central or grammar school, but in that year it received the name
of high school. It had a belfry on its southerly end, and a bell
with the rope coming down into a cross entry between the outer
door and the schoolroom. When the house was taken for an
engine house the bell was placed on the Russell street school
house, and when during some repairs, it was removed from that
building and abandoned, I captured it for Pilgrim Hall, where
it now is. The first bells, as large as this one, made in the
United States, were cast in Abington by Aaron Hobart in 1769,
under the direction of a deserter from the British Army, named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
Gallimore, a bell founder by trade. There can be little doubt
that the bell in question was made by Mr. Hobart in 1769. It
is not altogether gratifying that, with other customs of the past,
the ringing of bells should be falling into desuetude. The
Court bell no longer calls the liar to come to Court, the school
bell is silent, the funeral bell is not heard, even the fire
bell is giving way to the electric alarm, and I fear that
the church bell will be the next to fall asleep under the soporific
influence of fashion. But I trust that the day is far
distant when the sweet voice of the Sunday bell shall become
mute. Years ago when Julian, the great French composer of
instrumental music was in the habit of bringing out his new
pieces for the year, he played them for the first time at the series
of mask balls, beginning each year at Christmas. I had
been in Paris six months without hearing the church bell ringing
its summons to service, and I have never forgotten the
emotions stirred within me when I heard at the first ball in the
series, sixty years ago, the piece entitled “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la dimanche au sonneur</i>,”
the Sunday bells. The first time I saw the “Angelus”
by Millet, the same emotions were revived, and the music of
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la dimanche au sonneur</i>” is still ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>While talking of bells, I wonder how many of my readers
know how far church bells can be heard. I read a few years
ago an article in the <cite>Living Age</cite> on the rut of the sea, or as it
is better known, the roar of the ocean, which many persons
think is caused by the surf on the shore after a storm. I discovered
many years ago that this was not so, as I had often
heard it when there was no storm, and when there was scarcely
a ripple on the beach. The article referred to stated that the
rut was the sound of a distant storm, perhaps hundreds of
miles away, and illustrated the distance at which sounds can be
heard at sea by the following incident. A ship bound into
New York one Sunday forenoon was sailing close hauled on
the wind on the starboard tack about eighty miles dead to leeward
from Sandy Hook. The mate reported to the Captain
that he could hear the New York church bells. The captain
doubting it, went on deck and heard them distinctly. Putting
his ship into the wind, and thus shivering her light sails, he lost
the sound, but putting her off again the bells continued to be
heard. The sound of the bells reached the upper sails, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
was reflected to the deck. I was prepared to credit the
story, because I have been told by grand bank fishermen that
in old side wheel days they had heard the paddles of an ocean
steamer twelve miles away.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, let me say that in 1832 I
presented myself at the office of Dr. Winslow Warren, on the
corner of Main and North streets, chairman of the school committee,
to be examined for admission into the high school. The
requirements were at that time, an age of ten years, an ability
to read well and spell, to write a fair round hand, a knowledge
of Colburn’s first lessons, and Robinson’s arithmetic as far as
vulgar fractions, and ability to parse a simple sentence. I had
at that time not only gone beyond the requirements in my studies,
but had made a considerable advance in Latin. When I
entered the school it was kept by Samuel Ripley Townsend.
When he flogged a boy he did it neither in sorrow nor in anger,
but rather for the quiet fun it gave him. He wore spectacles,
and had a way of walking leisurely up the alley as if his
thoughts were far away from the school, and if any boy after
he had passed made a face behind his back, or threw a spit ball
at another boy, he would see the reflection in his spectacles, and
then going quietly to his desk, and taking out his cowhide,
would walk back apparently in an absent mood, and when he
walked by the boy he would bring the hide down smartly on his
back, and keep on his walk with an ill concealed smile on his
face as if he had played a joke on the offender.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend, son of Samuel and Abigail Townsend, was
born in Waltham, April 10, 1810, and graduated at Harvard in
1829. After leaving Plymouth he engaged in business in Boston
for a time, and afterwards taught the Bristol Academy
from 1846 to 1849, during which period he studied law with
Horatio Pratt, and was admitted to the Bristol bar in 1850. In
1853 he was chosen treasurer of Bristol County, serving three
years, and in 1858 was appointed Judge of the Police Court of
Taunton. After the dissolution of the court he practiced law
in Taunton, serving three terms as a member of the city council,
and in 1882 was appointed City Solicitor. He married
June 29, 1837, Mary Snow Percival, and died September 27,
1887.</p>

<p>In 1833 Mr. Townsend was succeeded by Isaac Nelson Stoddard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
born in Upton, October 30, 1812, who graduated at Amherst
in 1832. He taught the school about two years, and then
moved to New Bedford, where he taught until 1837, when he
returned to Plymouth, and again had charge of the school until
1841. In the latter year he was appointed collector of the
port, remaining in office until 1845, when he was made cashier
of the Plymouth Bank, continuing in office in that and its
successor, the Plymouth National Bank, until 1879, when he
was made president. He married in 1836, Martha Le Baron,
daughter of John B. Thomas, and died July 23, 1891. He
fitted John Goddard Jackson and myself for college during the
first half of 1838, when we carried on our studies at home,
and went to Mr. Stoddard’s house late each afternoon to recite.
While in New Bedford Mr. Stoddard became an intimate
friend of Judge Oliver Prescott, Judge of Probate of Bristol
county, and hence the name of our genial friend, Col. Stoddard.
The ordinary punishment to which the boys were subjected
by Mr. Stoddard, was a squeeze of the ear between his
thumb and forefinger, but the punishment for high offences was
a flogging on the soft parts, while the victim lay across a chair.
Some of my readers will doubtless remember Bill Randall, and
the jolly way in which he did everything. One day knowing
that Mr. Stoddard intended to flog him, he went to school prepared
for the occasion. When he was called out and told to
lie down he exhibited a protuberance never equalled by any
bustle of the dressmaker’s art, and as he took the blows which
might as well have been inflicted on a bale of wool, he would
wink to the other scholars as much as to say, “go ahead old fellow
if you enjoy it, go ahead.” Bill went to California, and
on a visit to Plymouth a few years ago he was the same old
Bill, and if he be living and sees these memories, he will have a
laugh over the flogging incident.</p>

<p>During Mr. Stoddard’s absence in New Bedford the first
teacher was Leonard Bliss of Rehoboth, a scholarly man, who
published a history of Rehoboth, a valuable contribution to historical
literature. After leaving Plymouth he went to Louisville,
Ky., and edited the <cite>Louisville Journal</cite>. For some offensive
remarks in the columns of his paper, he was shot dead
in his office. He was a son of Leonard and Lydia (Talbot)
Bliss, and was born in Swanzey, December 12, 1811.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Wm. H. Lord succeeded Mr. Bliss, a native of Portsmouth,
born September 10, 1812, and a graduate at Dartmouth in 1832.
He graduated at Andover Academy in 1837, and was settled
for a time over the Unitarian Societies of Southboro, Mass.,
and Madison, Wisconsin. At one time he edited a newspaper
in Port Washington, and was Consul at St. Thomas
from 1850 to 1853. He married Persis, daughter of Rev. Dr.
James Kendall, and died in Washington in 1866. He was a
popular teacher, and introduced a new feature into school
government, which proved successful. At the opening day of
his term he told his scholars that they might have the afternoon
of that day to themselves in the school room for the purpose of
enacting a code of rules for the management of the school, and
reporting the same to him the next day, but he wished them to
distinctly understand that when enacted, the rules were to be
obeyed. It requires no deep knowledge of human nature to
know that such a confidence in the good faith of the school
would be conscientiously respected. I do not remember a
single case of flogging under his administration.</p>

<p>Before the return of Mr. Stoddard to Plymouth in 1837 the
school was kept a short time by Robert Bartlett of Plymouth
of the Harvard class of 1836, and by LeBaron Russell of the
Harvard class of 1832, but nothing occurred during their
terms, especially worthy of notice, except the pranks usual in
every school. One of these pranks was tried on each teacher
in turn. In the cool days of autumn or spring, the fire in the
box stove was not kept up continuously, so some morning when
there was no fire, a bundle of seaweed was rammed down the
chimney, and soon after the school opened the boys began one
after another to shiver and ask for a fire. Of course, when
the fire was kindled, the room would fill with smoke, and the
usual result, the dismissal of the school, followed. There
were no janitors in those days, and each Saturday two boys
would be detailed to discharge during the next week a janitor’s
duties, including sweeping out, sawing wood, making
fires and ringing the bell. I do not think such work ever did
me any harm, indeed, I am sure that it taught me as much
that was useful as is taught today in some branches of instruction
included in the regular curriculum, for which special
salaried teachers are employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>A school called the town school, was kept in my day by
Thomas Drew in a house built in 1827, which has been recently
taken down. It stood also on School street, near the way
up Burial Hill, a little distance south of the high school house.
The boys attending that school were older and larger than the
high school boys, and when there was snow on the ground
there was scarcely a day without a pitched battle between the
two schools. During my time our leader was Abraham Jackson,
always cool and fearless, and generally leading his followers
to victory, and driving the enemy into their school.
He entered Harvard a year before I did, and on the Delta he
was the same hero in the strife that he was on Burial Hill
at home. More than once I have seen him there with ball in
hand rushing through the crowd with an impetus which no obstacle
could check, and heard the cry, “go it Jackson, go it
Jackson,” and then a cheer when he sent the ball home. I
can conceive of no danger from which Jackson would have retreated,
and of no act of daring which he would not if necessary
have performed. He once saved a boy from drowning,
who had ventured on thin ice in the middle of Murdock’s pond
and fallen through. While other boys were paralyzed with
fear he kept his presence of mind, and did just the right thing.
There was a pile of rails on the shore, and seizing two he dragged
them side by side near the broken ice, and then lying down
on them worked his way with his weight distributed over as
much surface as possible, to the boy, and taking him by the
collar, pulled him to the rails and to safety. He was always
a hero, and in war would have been a Cushing in Roanoke
river or a Hobson at Santiago.</p>

<p>A fuller history of Plymouth schools than I propose to give
in these memories, may be found in my Ancient Landmarks
of Plymouth, and I must content myself with saying that
after the school became the high school in 1826, the teachers,
omitting those already mentioned, were Addison Brown,
Harvard, 1826, George W. Hosmer, Harvard, 1826, who married
Hannah Poor, daughter of Rev. James Kendall, Horace
Hall Rolfe, born in Groton, N. H., July 20, 1800, graduated
at Dartmouth, 1824, married, 1828, Mary T., daughter of
Stephen Marcy, and died in Charleston, S. C., February 24,
1831, Josiah Moore, Harvard, 1826, who married in 1831,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
Rebecca W., daughter of Wm. Sturtevant, Charles Clapp, Mr.
Jenks, Philip Coombs Knapp, Dartmouth, 1841, John Brooks
Beal, Thomas Andrew Watson, Harvard, 1845, Samuel Sewall
Greeley, Harvard, 1844, Wm. H. Spear, J. W. Hunt,
Frank Crosby, Edward P. Bates, Admiral P. Stone, George
Lewis Baxter, Theodore P. Adams, Harvard, 1867, Joseph
Leavitt Sanborn, Harvard, 1867, Henry Dame, George Washington
Minns, Harvard, 1836, Gilman C. Fisher, and Charles
Burton, who was succeeded by teachers with whose names
my readers are familiar.</p>

<p>There are two of the above of whom I am able to furnish
meagre sketches. Charles Burton, son of Thomas and Elizabeth
(Deane) Burton, was born in Wolverhampton, England,
December 16, 1816, and about 1818 came to America with
his widowed mother and one brother and four sisters, and settled
in Pittsburgh, where in early life he learned the trade of
pattern maker. In Pittsburgh he became acquainted with
Lemuel Stephens, who was instructor there in Daniel Stone’s
private school, and about 1839 sailed with him for Germany
in a vessel belonging to I. and E. Morton. After a year’s
study in Gottingen and Heidelberg, he returned home, and
soon after came to Plymouth with messages from Mr. Stephens,
whose sister Sarah he afterwards married. He taught
first a private school on Watson’s Hill in a building erected
for the purpose, and for many years afterwards was associated
with the public schools of Plymouth, either as principal of the
high school or as superintendent of schools. He died November
25, 1894.</p>

<p>George Lewis Baxter, son of William W. and Ann E.
(Weld) Baxter, was born in Quincy, Oct. 21, 1842, and graduated
at Harvard in 1863. In 1864 he was principal of the
Reading High School, and afterwards for three years principal
of the high school in Plymouth. In 1867 he was appointed
headmaster of the Somerville high school, in which
capacity he is still serving with about four hundred and thirty
scholars under his charge. In 1872 he married Ida F. Paul,
and has a son, Gregory Paul Baxter, who graduated at Harvard
in 1896.</p>

<p>I entered college at sixteen, the usual age at that time, while
now it is eighteen. There are persons who believe that everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
is lovely in our day, and that our fathers were uneducated,
ignorant men. They claim that our public schools are
more efficient in instruction, and their pupils further advanced
than formerly. This I doubt. I began to study Latin at nine,
and I have no reasons to think that I was an exception. They
explain the advanced age of freshmen, by claiming that the
requirements for admission to college are greater, and this
claim I also doubt. They further claim that a higher scholarship
is reached by the graduate of the present time. But to
substantiate this claim, they should show first that the old instructors
were inferior to the present, and second that the various
activities of life are now represented by abler men than
ever before. But are Professor Felton in Greek, Professor
Beck in Latin, Professor Channing in Rhetoric and
Elocution, Professor Pierce in Mathematics, and Professor
Longfellow in French, outclassed by recent professors?
Then if we turn to the various professions we find among the
graduates of the earlier half of the last century in the ministry,
Wm. Ellery Channing, James Walker, Frederick Hedge,
George Putnam, Wm. P. Lunt, Henry W. Bellows, and Edward
Everett Hale; in law, Samuel Dexter, Lemuel Shaw,
Sidney Bartlett, Benjamin Robbins Curtis and William Whiting;
in literature, Wm. H. Prescott, George Bancroft, Jared
Sparks, Francis Parkman, J. Lothrop Motley, James Russell
Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes; in medicine, John Collins
Warren, Henry Bigelow and George H. Gay, and in statesmanship,
John Quincy Adams, Josiah Quincy, Harrison Gray
Otis, Edward Everett, Charles Sumner and George F. Hoar;
in science, Benjamin Pierce, Asa Gray and B. A. Gould. Is
a comparison with recent graduates unfavorable to these men?
I was told not many years ago by a distinguished scholar, a
graduate of Harvard, and one of its professors, that in his
opinion Harvard did not graduate as good scholars as it did
fifty years before. If this be true, I think there is a reason
for it. Many persons mistake bigness for greatness, but I
believe that sixteen hundred undergraduates cannot be moulded
as well as four hundred. There is not that personal interest
felt in the student by the instructors, which was once
felt. I am inclined to doubt whether in the faculty today
there is more than one member able to recognize and call by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
name fifty students. In my day it was different, and to apply
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, there was Charles Stearns Wheeler,
Greek tutor, the Pinkerton of the faculty, who boasted that
if day or night he could see the heel of a student going round
a corner he could give his name—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex pede herculem</i>. Only
a few incidents in my college career are worthy of mentioning.
I think I am one of very few students whose pardon has ever
been asked by a professor. One day while solving a problem
in geometry before Professor Pierce, or Benny, as we called
him, and performing my work with ease and rapidity, he stopped
me suddenly and sent me to my seat, telling me to begin
at the next recitation at the beginning of the text book,
which we were then half through. At the next recitation
he called me to the blackboard and asked me how far I
was prepared. I told him, “Up with the class,” and then
he began to screw me, giving me three problems in different
places in the book, which I solved with ease. He
then said, “Take your seat, and remain after the class leaves
the room.” When we were alone he said, “Davis, I thought
you were copying at the last recitation, but I am satisfied that
you were not, and I beg your pardon.” The students sometimes
marked difficult points in the problems on their cuffs, and
sometimes on a slip of paper, and the professor seeing me doing
my work so glibly, thought I had an auxiliary somewhere
about my person. He never alluded to the matter again, but
he manifested his regret by inviting me very frequently to
spend a part of a night with him, or his assistant in the observatory
to aid in recording magnetic or astronomical observations.</p>

<p>No professor was more interesting to me than Edward Tirrell
Channing, at the head of the department of rhetoric and
elocution. I think he made a deeper and broader mark on
the undergraduate mind than has been felt since his day. His
custom was to take up the themes, which he had examined,
and criticise them before the class. On one occasion, taking
up mine he said, “Davis, I have only one thing to say to you,
when you have written anything which you think particularly
fine, strike it out.” A member of my class published a
book of poems during his college course entitled, “Pebbles
from Castalia,” which we boys called, “Brickbats from Kennebunk.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
On one occasion he wrote a theme in verse, and
Channing taking it up said, “Mr. Blank, I see that in your
theme every line begins with a capital, what is the reason?”
“It is poetry, sir.” “Ah, poetry, is it, I did not think of that,
but hereafter, leave out some of your capitals.”</p>

<p>In my day there were five degrees of punishment: expulsion,
suspension, public admonition before the faculty, private
admonition by the president, and mild censure by the professor,
who had a room in college. There was a race course
a little more than a mile from the college which the boys often
attended to see trotting races under the saddle. One rider
was easy and graceful in riding jockey hitch. At one time
I was called before Professor Lovering who held the position
above referred to, and told by him that I was reported for
attending the race on the Wednesday before. I said, “Yes, I
was there, and saw you there.” “Well, how do you like
jockey hitch,” he asked, and after we had exchanged our
views on that style of riding, he bade me good morning. This
mild censure reminds me of a story told of Professor Felton,
one of whose brothers, some twenty years younger than himself,
was an undergraduate, and was reported for swearing
in the college yard. The faculty requested the professor to
speak to his brother, so sending a messenger for him to come
to his recitation room he told him that he had been reported
as above mentioned. “Yes,” his brother said, “I plead guilty,
but I do not often indulge in profanity.” “Damnation, John,
what do you mean by using the word profanity. There is
no such word; profaneness, John, profaneness, not profanity—you
may go.”</p>

<p>Josiah Quincy, born in Boston, Feb. 4, 1772, a Harvard
graduate of 1790, was president during my term. He had
occupied the positions of member of congress, state senator,
mayor of Boston, and Judge of the Boston Municipal Court,
when he was chosen president in 1829, serving until 1845. He
was sixty-six years of age, when I entered college, but appeared
much older. He bore the reputation of being absent
minded, but though many of the stories illustrating this mental
condition, are probably untrue, an instance of it once occurred
under my own eye and ear. He and Hon. Tyler
Bigelow, the father of Chief Justice Geo. Tyler Bigelow, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
intimate friends, and their families were also intimate. Meeting
one day in the waiting room of the Old Colony station
some years after the death of Mr. Bigelow’s wife, Mr. Quincy
asked him how Mrs. Bigelow was. Putting his hand to his
ear, as he was very deaf, Mr. Bigelow said, “What did you
say?” Mr. Quincy raising his voice said, “How is Mrs.
Bigelow.” Mr. Bigelow said, “Speak louder,” and Mr.
Quincy called out in his loudest voice, attracting the attention
of every one in the room, “How is Mrs. Bigelow.” “Dead,
dead,” said Mr. Bigelow, much to the amusement of the crowd.
Mr. Quincy was a noble man. He loved Boston, and was
devoted to its interests. The city owned what was called city
wharf, opposite the Quincy Market, and when he was about
eighty years of age the city government voted to sell it by
auction. Mr. Quincy protested publicly against the sale of
property which in his judgment would appreciate largely in
value in the near future. No attention was paid to his protest,
and the sale went on. He bought it, and then offered
it to the city at the price he paid, but his offer was refused.
I have heard his profits on the purchase put as high as a half
a million of dollars. He died in Quincy, July 1, 1864, at
the age of ninety-two.</p>

</div>


<p>As has been already stated, in the early days of the Plymouth
Colony, town meetings were held in either the Governor’s
house, or the meeting house. The last meeting in the meeting
house, so far as the record shows, was held July 6, 1685.
In that year Plymouth County was incorporated with Plymouth,
the shire, and though I can find no record of the event,
it is probable that the County Court house, which stood on the
site of the present town house, was built in that year, and
that from that time it was the meeting place of the town.
There are scattering records of town meetings held there before
it was taken down in 1749, in which year the present
town house was built by the county as a Court House. In
anticipation of the erection of the present house it was voted by
the town at a meeting held in the Court House, Oct. 10, 1748,
“to give towards building a new house three hundred pounds
old tenor, provided that the town shall have free use and improvement
of the said building, as long as it stands, to transact
any of the public affairs of the town in.” On the 6th of
March, 1749, it was voted “that the town will add to their
former vote for building a Court House, the sum of seven
hundred pounds old tenor... provided that the Court of General
sessions for this county at its next sessions shall order
that the said Court House shall immediately be built, and that
the town have the privilege of transacting their public affairs
in the same so long as the said house shall stand.”</p>

<p>At the next session of the court it was voted to accept the
additional grant and a copy of the vote was attested by Edward
Winslow, clerk.</p>

<p>In order that my readers may understand the meaning of
old tenor money, let me say, that there were three issues of
paper money by the Massachusetts province prior to 1750.
The issues prior to 1737 were called old tenor, the issue made
in that year was called middle tenor, and the issue of 1741,
new tenor. When the province bills were redeemed in 1750,
the old tenor was redeemed at the rate of one piece of a dollar
for forty-five shillings of old tenor, which would make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
amount paid to the county a fraction over $444.44. This
sum it must be remembered was in addition to the share of the
cost of the building to be assessed on the town in its county
tax.</p>

<p>In 1749, then, the present town house, was erected. A
somewhat doubtful tradition ascribes its design to Peter Oliver,
who in 1747 was appointed Judge of the Inferior Court of
Plymouth County; and a still more doubtful tradition states
that originally its entrance was on the easterly end and was
changed about 1786 to the north side, where it is now. After
a careful examination of the latter tradition, I have reached
the conclusion that it is erroneous. A market was established
as early as 1722, and for more than a hundred years clerks
of the market were annually chosen by the town. Having
examined every land title from Wellingsley to Cold Spring,
and found no mention of a market anywhere except under
the town house, I am satisfied that the basement of both the
old and new building contained a market from 1722 to the
time of its comparatively recent abandonment in 1858. The
tradition therefore concerning the change of the entrance to
admit of the establishment of a market probably refers, not
to the present building, but to the old one in which a change
of plan may have been made to admit of the establishment
of a market in 1722. There is no reason to doubt the statement
that at one time there was a one story wooden projection
as far out as the sidewalk to furnish larger accommodations
for the market, but it was removed before my day, and
the market was confined to the basement alone. The market
in my day was equipped with stalls, which were leased by the
clerk of the market to various persons, among whom I remember
Elisha and Charles Nelson, Amasa Holmes, Joseph White,
Brackley Cushing and Maltiah Howard. The interior arrangement
of the town house was much the same as now, except
that a safe has in later times been built, and the old Court
room occupied the whole of the second story. The Court
room was provided with a raised desk for the judge, a desk
below for the clerk, a sheriff’s box on one side, a court crier’s
box on the other, the jury seats facing the judge, and separating
the lawyer’s area from the space for the public in the rear.
Such was the arrangement of the building until 1820, when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
new Court House having been built in Court Square, the
building was sold to the town for the sum of two thousand
dollars. It remained practically unchanged until 1829, when
the Torrent No. 4, a suction hose engine was bought, and the
room at the westerly end was fitted for its accommodation.
For the supply of water to this engine, and the Niagara No. 1,
which was at the same time changed to a suction engine, reservoirs
were built in Shirley and Town Squares to be filled
by the aqueduct. The specifications for these reservoirs required
them to be sixteen feet in diameter in the clear, and
fourteen feet deep from the spring of the arch. To complete
the story of the reservoirs, that on Training Green was built
in 1834, that at the crossing of High and Spring streets, and
that opposite Pilgrim Hall in 1853, and one at the foot of Russell
street at an earlier period.</p>

<p>All through my boyhood the Town House remained as I
have described it until 1839, when all the equipments of the
old Court room except the judge’s desk were removed and
substantial seats were built on a sloping floor, which necessitated
three more steps on the stairs. In 1858, while I was
chairman of the selectmen, the engine Torrent was removed
to the basement, and the room and ante-room, recently occupied
by the selectmen, were fitted for use by the board. As first
arranged, a large, round table with five drawers was constructed
around an iron column in the room, which was removed
some years later. The hall above was used for meetings
of the town until 1872, since which time they have been
held in Davis Hall and Odd Fellows’ Hall, and the Armory.
At a later date it was occupied by the Public Library for a
short time, and then divided into rooms, one of which was
occupied until recently by the school committee, and the other
is now occupied by the Assessors. It may be interesting to
some of my readers to learn that Catholic mass was celebrated
in Town Hall, April 4, 1849.</p>

<p>While this book is in press, the selectmen have remodelled
the interior and built a new and larger safe.</p>

<p>My first connection with town affairs began in 1854, when
I was chosen a member of the school committee. I had the
previous year become a permanent resident of Plymouth, after
some years residence in Boston, and until 1892, a period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
thirty-eight years, I do not recall a year in which I did not
hold a town office. In 1855 I was chosen a selectman with
Jacob H. Loud, chairman, and Ezekial C. Turner, Israel Clark
and Ezra Leach, my other associates. In 1856 I was chairman,
associated with Joseph Allen, Joseph P. Brown, Bradford
Barnes and David Clark, and 1857-8-9, the board remained
unchanged. In 1860 I remained chairman with Joseph
P. Brown, Ezekial C. Turner, David Clark and Thomas B.
Sears my associates, and in 1861 my associates were Lysander
Dunham, Hosea Bartlett, Thomas B. Sears and
Ezekial C. Turner, the same board continuing in office
until the spring of 1866, when I declined further service.
I was again chosen in 1870 and 1881, but declined serving,
and was finally chosen in 1888, ’89, ’90, serving the last
year as chairman. At regular, adjourned and special meetings,
and November elections, I served as moderator seventy-nine
times.</p>

<p>During my first service as moderator, the men who took the
most active part in discussions were Moses Bates, Wm. H.
Spear, Ichabod Morton, Charles G. Davis, Wm. H. Whitman,
Captain John Russell, Jonathan Thrasher, Nathaniel Ellis,
Charles H. Howland, Barnabas H. Holmes, Samuel H. Doten
and Chas. O. Churchill. Occasionally the debates were spirited
and personal. Some of the above were remarkable men.
Jonathan Thrasher born and brought up, and a life-long resident,
at Long Pond, denied favorable opportunities of instruction,
was a man of large brain, who under the sunlight of a
higher education, would have been a formidable competitor in
the arena of professional life. When he spoke he at once
arrested attention by his calm and judicial manner, and well
expressed arguments, which were the result of careful thought.
Nathaniel Ellis of Ellisville, was also a man of mark, vigorous
in mind and body, ready in speech, and at every opportunity
keen in ridicule and satire. I remember the roars of
laughter, elicited by his speech in opposition to an additional
appropriation asked for by a school committee, in whom
he had no confidence. He described one of their junkets,
hiring a two horse carriage, stowing under the seats lemons
and sugar and sandwiches and cold chicken and pickles, and
the purpose of their service in behalf of the town, the conveyance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
of an inkstand to the Ellisville school of four scholars. He
said it was the same committee which went on a similar junket
to examine the Red Brook School, and learned from the teacher
after their erudite examination was finished that Red Brook
school was in Sandwich, and not in Plymouth. It is needless
to say that the additional appropriation was defeated. Ichabod
Morton on every question relating to schools was conspicuous
in debate. He was an ardent advocate for larger appropriations
for public schools, and though often subjected to ridicule by
his opponents, he never lost his temper and waited patiently
for time to prove in the end that one with a righteous cause
was a majority. At the time to which I refer in 1855 and 1860,
the appropriations for schools were $8,600, and $10,000, respectively,
with a population of six thousand, while the appropriation
for the present year is forty-nine thousand dollars,
to which the interest on the school debt must be added, with
little less than double the population.</p>

<p>In performing the duties of moderator many questions arise
for which neither law nor parliamentary usage furnishes any
solution. He possesses arbitrary power which he must be careful
in exercising. Some of the questions which came up during
my service in that office were sufficiently interesting to justify
a reference to them. On one occasion an article in the warrant
involved an appropriation to which the voters in the south part
of the town were opposed, and after a full discussion the appropriation
was defeated, and the town passed on to the consideration
of other articles in the warrant. In the latter part of
the afternoon, after the southern voters had left for home, a
motion was made to reconsider the vote of rejection, and with
no rule of law to guide me, but one of fair play and square
dealing, I ruled the motion out of order. I stated that the
person moving reconsideration failed to make it before other
business was done, and not having made it or given notice that
he intended to make it, before adjournment, the
opponents of the measure had a right to consider the question
settled for the day. Some complained of the ruling, but its
fairness was afterwards conceded, and so far as I know has
been adopted as a guide for other moderators.</p>

<p>On another occasion, while several articles in the warrant
remained unconsidered, a motion was made to adjourn, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
I ruled out of order. It was claimed that a motion to adjourn
was always in order, and was undebatable. That is undoubtedly
true in any body or convention, which has regular
sessions, for in that case an adjournment means merely an adjournment
to the next session, and the business arrested by
the adjournment can be resumed when the next session comes
together. But in a town meeting, unless it has been voted
that when the meeting adjourns, it shall adjourn to meet at
a certain time, a motion to adjourn cannot be entertained.
There were only two courses which the mover might have
pursued. He might have moved as above that when the meeting
adjourns it adjourn to a certain time, and then if the town
so votes a simple motion to adjourn would have been in order;
or he might have moved that the consideration of the remaining
articles in the warrant be indefinitely postponed, and if
the town so vote, he could have moved to dissolve the meeting.
A motion to adjourn unless there is a fixed time to adjourn
to is simply an absurdity.</p>

<p>Under the old system of voting for town officers each set
of officers was chosen on a separate ballot, and the counting
of each set of ballots before balloting for the next officers
involved great labor and delay. In order to expedite matters,
a motion was made at the annual meeting in 1882 to instruct
the moderator to appoint tellers, and I ruled the motion out
of order, as being in controvention of the law. Many towns
had been in the habit of employing tellers and their example
was quoted as sufficient precedents for my guidance. I stated
in general terms that the law conferred on the moderator extraordinary
powers, and imposed upon him responsible duties
which he could no more delegate to another than a constable
or an assessor could delegate to a substitute his powers and
duties. At the adjourned meeting I gave my reasons in writing
to the town, and a reporter for the Boston <cite>Herald</cite> being
present, had it printed in full in the Sunday edition of that
paper. The legislature was still in session, and the judiciary
committee acknowledging the correctness of my ruling at once
secured the passage of an act authorizing the appointment of
tellers in town meetings.</p>

<p>The question has often been asked whether a moderator
can participate in debate. I am clearly of the opinion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
except for the purpose of explaining rulings and answering
questions within certain limitations, he cannot with propriety
engage in the discussion of any measure before the town. It
is extremely doubtful whether if he takes a marked interest in
a debate he can secure the confidence of the town in the entire
impartiality of his rulings and acts. For the same reason I
do not believe in the propriety of his leaving the chair to
speak from the floor. If, however, he should do so, I am
clearly of the opinion that he vacates his chair, and that the
only business before the town is to choose a moderator pro
tern. His powers and duties cease the moment he leaves the
chair, and they cannot be assumed by another upon whom
they are not conferred by the town by ballot, and the use of the
checklist.</p>

<p>How far a moderator shall go in ruling on the illegality
of a proposition contained in the warrant, it is difficult to lay
down any rule. There are many moderators unfamiliar with
the laws who would necessarily permit the consideration of the
article, trusting to the meeting to decide on the arguments in
which illegality is alleged whether the proposition shall be rejected.
If in such a case an illegal vote is favored a remedy
may be found on an application to the court for an injunction.</p>

<p>On the whole the ruling must be left to the judgment of
the moderator, who would not hesitate to rule, for instance,
out of order an article to see if the town will build a steamboat
to run between Plymouth and Boston.</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without suggesting that, while
the most stringent laws are in force to prevent illegal voting
in the elections of officers, a law should be enacted either excluding
non voters from the floor at town meetings, or prescribing
such a method of voting on appropriations as shall
preclude the possibility of illegal voting. If other methods
are impracticable it might at least be provided that in voting
on appropriations exceeding $5,000, voters shall pass between
two tellers appointed by the moderator and standing in front
of the platform, who shall count the votes and report to the
moderator.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January, 1820, the Pilgrim Society was incorporated
and a committee of arrangements consisting of
Nathan Hayward, Wm. Davis, Jr., and Nathaniel Spooner was
chosen for the celebration of the next anniversary of the Landing
of the Pilgrims. It was determined to make the first demonstration
of the Society a memorable one. It is creditable to
the foresight of the society that they selected Mr. Webster for
orator. He was only thirty-eight years of age, and had not so
far as was generally known, reached the maturity of his powers.
Before coming from Portsmouth to Boston in 1816, he
had served two terms in the lower house of Congress, and was
then practicing successfully at the Suffolk bar. He had, however,
leaped into fame by his argument in the United States Supreme
Court in 1818 in the Dartmouth College case. In 1769
a corporation called the “Trustees of Dartmouth College” was
chartered to have perpetual existence, and power to hold and
dispose of the lands for the use of the college, and the right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
fill vacancies in their own body. In 1816 the New Hampshire
legislature changed the corporate name to “The trustees of
Dartmouth University,” and made the twelve trustees, together
with nine others to be appointed by the Governor and council,
a new corporation with the property of the old corporation,
with power to establish new colleges and an institution under
the control of twenty-five overseers. After a transfer of the
property had been made the old trustees brought an action of
trover to recover it on the ground of the unconstitutionality
of the act. The act of the legislature was declared constitutional
by the Superior Court of New Hampshire, and by a writ
of error the case was carried to the United States Supreme
Court in 1818, where, in 1819, the decision of the New Hampshire
Court was reversed, and the act of the legislature declared
unconstitutional. Mr. Webster’s argument had never
before been equalled, and has never since been surpassed.</p>

<p>At the time of the celebration, whoever, within an easy distance
from Boston, could secure accommodations in Plymouth
availed himself of the opportunity. I have letters addressed
to my grandfather, written in August, asking him to engage
lodgings of some sort. There were three hotels in Plymouth,
all of them crowded with guests, and every spare bed in town
was secured. On the day of the celebration, by stage, by private
carriage, and public hack, visitors came on a two days’
trip in the dead of winter, fortunate if able to obtain a whole
or a part of a bed, while the drivers slept in their carriages. But
fortunately the day of the celebration was as mild as Indian
summer. I was told many years ago by a man who remembered
it, that he sat through a part of the day by an open window
in his shirt sleeves. There has been preserved by the
Pilgrim Society a parchment containing the autographs of
all who attended the dinner, so that the array of distinguished
men who listened to Mr. Webster is not left to the imagination.
Among the visitors were, Rev. John T. Kirkland, President
of Harvard, Professors Edward Everett, Geo. Ticknor
and Levi Hedge, Rev. Abiel Abbot, Rev. Abiel Holmes, Rev.
John G. Palfrey, Rev. John Pierce, Rev. Converse Francis,
Rev. James Flint, Rev. Alexander Young, Rev. Charles Lowell,
Rev. Francis Parkman, Rev. Wm. P. Lunt, Judge John
Davis, Isaac P. Davis, Thomas H. Perkins, Francis C. Gray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
Levi Lincoln, Stephen Salisbury, Timothy Bigelow, Laban W.
Wheaton, Martin Brimmer, Benjamin Rotch, Amos Lawrence,
Thomas Bulfinch, Theron Metcalf, Nahum Mitchell, Wm. S.
Otis, George A. Trumbull, Augustus Peabody, Henderson
Inches, Francis Baylies, Willard Phillips, Henry Grinnell,
Samuel A. Eliot, Isaiah Thomas, Dudley A. Tyng, Isaac McClellan,
Amos Binney and others of no less distinction. No
such an assembly had ever before gathered in New England
as that which filled the church of the First Parish on that
memorable day. The scene was worthy of the best efforts
of the painter’s art. The galleries reserved for the ladies,
seemed with the mingling of colors in dress and hats and fans
like banks of summer flowers mellowing the sombre garb
worn by the society and their guests on the floor below. Mr.
Webster wearing small clothes and buckles and shoes, and
over all a silk gown, stood on a raised platform in front of the
high oak pulpit and began his oration with words to which
his audience was in the spirit to heartily respond, “Let us rejoice
that we behold this day.”</p>

<p>Perhaps that part of the oration which gave to it its chief distinction,
was that denunciatory of the slave trade. A law was
passed by Congress in 1808 abolishing the trade, but it had
slumbered on the statute books until Mr. Webster twelve years
later, breathed into it the breath of life. In a town, which was
in early days within the Plymouth colony, the trade was still
carried on, and by this fact the scathing words of the oration
were inspired. “I hear the sound of the hammer. I see the
smoke of the furnace where manacles and fetters are still
forged for human limbs. I see the visages of those who by
stealth and at midnight labor in this work of hell, foul and
dark as may become the artificers of such instruments of
misery and torture. Let that spot be purified, or let it cease
to be of New England.”</p>

<p>There was another passage, never more needed than today
to be impressed on the public mind, relating to military
achievements. “Great actions and striking occurrences having
excited a temporary admiration often pass away and are forgotten.
* * Such is frequently the fortune of the most
brilliant military achievements. Of the ten thousand battles
which have been fought; of all the fields fertilized with carnage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
of the banners which have been bathed in blood; of the
warriors who have hoped that they had risen from the field
of conquest to a glory as bright and as durable as the stars,
how few that continue to interest mankind. The victory of
yesterday is reversed by the defeat of today; the star of military
glory rising like a meteor, like a meteor has fallen; disgrace
and disaster hang on the heels of conquest and renown;
victor and vanquished presently pass away to oblivion, and the
world goes on in its course with the loss only of so many lives,
and so much treasure.”</p>

<p>A dinner was served in the Court House, then building, by
John Blaney Bates of Plymouth, who also served the supper
for the ball held in the same place. I have a letter addressed
to my grandfather in the summer of 1820, showing that an
invitation to Mr. Everett to deliver a poem after the oration
was contemplated, and that Mr. Everett said he would accept
such an invitation. But wise counsels prevailed, and it was
thought best to give to Mr. Webster alone the honors of the
day.</p>

<p>In 1822 Rev. Eliphalet Porter of Roxbury delivered an address
before the Pilgrim Society, but no record of the ceremonies
of the day have been preserved.</p>

<p>In 1824 Edw. Everett was the orator of the Pilgrim Society,
and on Wednesday, the 22d of December, a crowd of strangers
visited the town to hear the eloquent orator. Mr. Everett,
after graduating at Harvard in 1811, was settled pastor of the
Brattle street church in 1813, to succeed Rev. Joseph Stevens
Buckminster, who died in 1812. In 1814 he was chosen
Eliot Professor of Greek at Harvard, and from 1815 to 1819,
he spent in study and travel in Europe preparing for his duties
as Professor. In 1819 he returned and entered upon his office,
resigning in 1824, in which year he delivered an address before
the Phi Beta Society, and was chosen member of Congress.
His oration was a splendid effort, and I was told by Rev. Samuel
K. Lothrop, who was present, that it was repeatedly said
at the time that his oration came fully up to the Webster standard.
But time failed to justify the comparison. Beauty of
imagery, and a grace of delivery, captivated for the hour, but
like the elusive tints of the rainbow, they were forgotten,
when the thunder and lightning which had preceded it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
recalled. After the oration, a dinner was served in Pilgrim
Hall, the cornerstone of which was laid on the first of
the previous September, and which was finished in time for
the celebration.</p>

<p>The celebration in 1829 was the first of which I have any
recollection. I was then seven years of age, but I remember
being carried up North street and along Main and Court streets
to see the illumination of the town on the evening before the
celebration. Even that I should perhaps have failed to remember
had I not got something in one of my eyes and gone
home crying. Hon. William Sullivan of Boston delivered the
oration, the son of James Sullivan, who was Governor of Massachusetts
in 1807. Mr. Sullivan was one of the leaders of the
Boston bar, but as far as I know this was the first opportunity
to display his powers as an orator. During a winter’s residence
in Philadelphia in 1844, I became intimate with his son,
John T. S. Sullivan, a man of more varied accomplishments
than any man I ever personally knew. He was a master of the
Spanish, French, Italian and German languages, was an excellent
singer, a skilful performer on the piano, guitar, banjo
and harp, and a story teller who would put Depew and Choate
to the blush.</p>

<p>On Monday, December 22, 1834, Rev. George W. Blagden
of the Boston Old South church, was the orator of the Pilgrim
Society, and in the absence of the President, Dr. Zaccheus
Bartlett presided, assisted by Judah Alden of Duxbury,
Wilkes Wood of Middleboro, Wm. W. Swain of New Bedford,
Henry J. Oliver of Boston, John Thomas of Kingston, and
Josiah Robbins of Plymouth. Samuel Doten was chief marshall,
and the dinner in Pilgrim Hall, as well as supper for
the ball in the same place, was furnished by Danville Bryant
of the Pilgrim House. During the year preceding the celebration
a handsome glass chandelier fitted for candles was
hung in Pilgrim Hall, and the present wooden portico was
built. During the day Dr. James Thacher, then eighty years
of age, was knocked down and run over by a carriage, but
not seriously injured.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. George Washington Blagden, son of George and
Anne (Davies) Blagden, was born in Washington, D. C.
October 3, 1802 and graduated at Yale in 1823 and at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
Andover Theological Seminary in 1827. He was ordained in
Brighton, Mass, in 1827, installed in the Salem street church
in Boston in 1830 and in the Old South church in Boston, in
1836. He was made Doctor of Divinity by Yale in 1843, by
Union College in 1849 and by Harvard in 1850. While <em>pastor
emeritus</em> of the Old South, he died Dec. 17, 1884.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, December 22, 1835, an oration was delivered
before the Pilgrim Society by Hon. Peleg Sprague of Boston.
Mr. Sprague, son of Seth and Deborah (Sampson) Sprague
of Duxbury, was born April 27, 1793, and graduated at Harvard
in 1812. He studied law at Litchfield law school, and
was admitted to the Plymouth bar in 1815, and settled in Augusta,
Maine, removing at the end of two years to Hallowell.
He was Representative in 1820-1; member of Congress from
1825 to 1829; United States Senator from 1829 to 1835, when he
moved to Boston. He was Judge of the United States District
Court from 1847 to 1865, and died in Boston, October 13, 1886.
On that occasion Samuel Doten was chief marshal, assisted by
John Tribble, Sylvanus Harlow, Eliab Ward, John Washburn,
Ichabod Shaw and Nelson Holmes. At the dinner Alden Bradford,
the president of the society presided, assisted by Jos.
Tilden of Boston; Wilkes Wood of Middleboro; Phineas
Sprague of Duxbury; Dr. Samuel West of Tiverton; Samuel
A. Frazier of Duxbury, and Benjamin Rodman of New Bedford.
Hon. Edw. Everett of Boston was one of the numerous
speakers, and Miss Harriet Martineau, who was the guest of
Dr. Zaccheus Bartlett, was present at both the dinner and ball.
She was very deaf, and conversation with her was difficult.
I was a boy of thirteen, but I remember standing near her accompanied
by Mrs. Dr. Winslow Warren, when Judge Warren
as he joined the group was asked if he did not wish to be introduced
to her. The air of the hall was thick and heavy with
dust, which together with the music of the band made the ear
sensitive to sounds, and as the Judge replied that he could not
make her hear he was surprised to hear her say “I think, Judge,
that you will have no difficulty.” I had once very much the
same experience. I called on a friend who had a guest who
had been stone deaf many years, and had learned the art of
reading what was said, in the motion of the lips. I did not
know this, and when my host left the room temporarily, I asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
her to return soon, as it would be embarrassing to be left with a
person with whom I could not engage in conversation, and was
astonished to hear the lady say she thought we could talk well
enough together. Though I wore a moustache her eye read
what her ear could not hear.</p>

<p>In 1837 an address was delivered before the Pilgrim Society
by Rev. Robert B. Hall, a notice of whom may be found in a
previous chapter, to which I take this opportunity to add that
in 1849, after his return to Plymouth to take up a permanent
residence, he accepted an invitation to preach for a time in the
Robinson church.</p>

<p>In 1838 Rev. Thomas Robbins of Rochester delivered an
anniversary address before the Pilgrim Society. Mr. Robbins,
son of Ammi Ruhamah and Elizabeth (LeBaron) Robbins,
was born in Norfolk, Conn., August 11, 1777. He entered
Yale College in 1792, and in 1795 removed to Williams College,
where he graduated in 1796. Immediately after his graduation
he returned to Yale and graduated there in the same year.
He spent two years in teaching in Sheffield, Mass., and Torringford,
Conn., and in studying for the ministry. In 1798 he
was licensed to preach by the Litchfield North Association,
and engaged in missionary service until 1809, when he was
settled in East Windsor, where he remained until 1827. After
a year at Stratford, Conn., he was settled in that part of
Rochester, Mass., which is now Mattapoisett, where he remained
until 1846. He gathered a valuable library, which he gave
to the Connecticut Historical Society, with the understanding
that he should be appointed librarian with a suitable salary,
and he continued in that office until his death, which occurred
at Colebrook, Conn., September 13, 1856.</p>

<p>At the celebration, December 22, 1841, Hon. Joseph Ripley
Chandler of Philadelphia, delivered the oration. A dinner
was served in the lower Pilgrim Hall, at which Hon. Nathaniel
Morton Davis, president of the society, presided, assisted by
Abraham Hammatt of Ipswich, Pelham Winslow Warren of
Lowell, Joshua Thomas Stevenson of Boston, Gershom B.
Weston of Duxbury, Thomas Prince Beal of Kingston, and
Barnabas Churchill of Plymouth. Among the speakers were
Samuel M. Burnside, President of the American Antiquarian
Society, and Rev. John L. Russell. Mr. Chandler was born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
in Kingston, August 25, 1792, and early became a clerk in
Boston, soon after teaching school, and about 1815 removing
to Philadelphia. In that city he and his wife engaged in teaching
a school, and in 1822 he became connected with the
<cite>United States Gazette</cite>, and from 1826 to 1847, was editor.
He was a member of the city council from 1832 to 1848, a
delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1836, a member
of Congress from 1849 to 1855, and travelled in Europe
from 1855 to 1858, in which latter year he was minister to the
two Sicilies. He died in Philadelphia, July 10, 1880.</p>

<p>In 1845 the Pilgrim Society departed from their usual custom,
and omitting an oration, celebrated the twenty-second
of December by a short service in the First church, at which
Rev. Dr. Francis Wayland, president of Brown University,
and Rev. Dr. James Kendall officiated, and a dinner in the
passenger station of the Old Colony Railroad, which had been
closed in and floored over for the purpose. On that occasion
Pelham W. Hayward was chief marshal, and as one of
the marshals, I then began in an humble way, a participation
in the celebrations of the Pilgrim Society, which has continued
in the various positions of chief marshal, member of the
committee of arrangements, and presiding officer without interruption
down to the present time. At the dinner Hon.
Charles Henry Warren, president of the society presided, assisted
by Col. John B. Thomas of Plymouth, Henry Crocker,
Abbot Lawrence and David Sears of Boston, and John H.
Clifford of New Bedford. The dinner was served by J. B.
Smith of Boston, and was contributed to by a baron of beef
from Daniel Webster, and a turbot and saddle of mutton
brought from England in the Cunard Steamer Acadia, from
S. S. Lewis, the agent of the Cunard Company. The speakers
were Josiah Quincy, president of Harvard, Rufus Choate,
George S. Hillard, Edward Everett and Nathaniel Morton
Davis, ex-president of the society. Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes read a poem, written for the occasion, entitled “The
Pilgrim’s Vision.”</p>

<p>The speech of Mr. Everett is worthy of special comment
as showing how thoroughly he had studied the art of oratory.
Before the dinner he sent a message to the caterer, Mr.
Smith, asking him to place an orange by the side of his plate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
At the close of his speech, after refuting the charge that the
Pilgrims were narrow and bigoted he said, “But by their
fruits ye shall know them; not by the graceful foliage which
dallies with the summer breeze; nor by the flower which fades
and scatters its perfume on the gale; but by the golden, perfect
fruit (seizing the orange, and lifting it above his head)
in which the genial earth, and ripening sun have garnered up
treasures for the food of man, and which in its decay leaves
behind it the germs of a continued and multiplying existence.”</p>

<p>The next celebration conducted by the Pilgrim Society occurred
August 1, 1853, the anniversary of the departure of
the Pilgrims from Delfthaven. On the 16th of June in that
year a committee of arrangements was chosen by the trustees
consisting of Richard Warren of New York, president of the
society, Timothy Gordon, Andrew L. Russell, Eleazer C.
Sherman and Wm. S. Russell of Plymouth; Nathaniel B.
Shurtleff, Charles Henry Warren and James T. Hayward of
Boston. I was appointed Chief Marshal, and I appointed
Samuel H. Doten and John D. Churchill, aids and the following
assistant marshals; Wm. Atwood, Wm. Bishop, Charles
O. Churchill, Winslow Drew, John H. Harlow, Barnabas
Hedge, George H. Jackson, Thomas Loring, John J. Russell,
Edward W. Russell, Nathaniel B. Spooner, George Simmons,
Jeremiah Farris, Samuel Shaw, B. H. Holmes, Isaac Brewster,
Wm. R. Drew, George G. Dyer, Daniel J. Lane, Wm. H.
Nelson and George Bramhall of Plymouth; Waterman French
of Abington; Phillip D. Kingman of Bridgewater; Matthias
Ellis of Carver; Charles Henry Thomas, Wm. Ellison and
George B. Standish of Duxbury; James H. Mitchell of East
Bridgewater; James H. Wilder of Hingham; Perez Simmons
of Hanover; Nathan Cushing of Hanson; Robert Gould of
Hull; Joseph S. Beal of Kingston; Harrison Staples of Lakeville;
J. Sampson, Jr., of Middleboro; W. N. Ellis of Marion;
George M. Baker of Marshfield; G. W. Bryant of North
Bridgewater; Zacheus Parker of Plympton; George F. Hatch
of Pembroke; Theophilus King of Rochester; Wm. P. Allen
of Scituate; Albion Turner of South Scituate; Thomas Ames
of West Bridgewater; Lewis Kenney of Wareham; LeBaron
Russell, Rufus B. Bradford, Solomon J. Gordon, George P.
Hayward, Thomas Russell, Isaac Winslow and Pelham W.
Hayward of Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>A large number of guests was invited, including the President
of the United States; members of the cabinet; the Governor
of Massachusetts; members of Congress and U. S. Senators
from Massachusetts; the Mayor of Boston; President
of the Massachusetts Senate, and Speaker of the House of
Representatives; Wm. H. Seward, John J. Crittenden, Nathaniel
P. Banks, Charles H. Warren, Robert C. Winthrop,
Abbott Lawrence, Josiah Quincy, Judge Peleg Sprague,
George Bancroft, John P. Kennedy, the presidents of
Harvard, Yale, Williams, Brown, and Amherst colleges,
Jared Sparks, John P. Hale, Edward Everett, Oliver
W. Holmes, the Plymouth Church, Southwark, England,
the authorities of Delfthaven, Leyden, Southampton and
old Plymouth, the New England societies of New York,
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Charleston, Pittsburg, Cincinnati,
Louisville, St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco
and Washington, and many others, too numerous to mention.
The New York Light Guard, which had been invited
to attend the celebration with the New England Society of
New York, arrived in the afternoon of Sunday, and with
Dodworth’s band marched to their quarters provided in the
old Hedge house in Leyden street, which happened at that
time to be vacant, and was fitted up for their accommodation.
The town was profusely decorated; arches were erected on
Court, Main, North, Summer and Pleasant streets, and every
building was decorated with flags and mottoes. The inscription
in large letters on the house of Wm. Brewster Barnes,
opposite Pilgrim Hall, “August 1, Forefathers’ Day Thawed
Out” attracted much attention. The features of the day were
a religious service in the First Church in the early forenoon,
a procession and a dinner. The service consisted of Scripture
reading by Rev. Dr. George W. Blagden of the Old South
Church in Boston, a prayer by Rev. Dr. James Kendall, preceded
and followed by the singing of appropriate hymns, and
a benediction by Rev. Chas. S. Porter of Plymouth. The
dinner was provided by John Wright of Boston in a mammoth
tent, which covered more than the easterly half of Training
Green, with the speaker’s platform in the middle of the westerly
side, and was set for twenty-five hundred persons. The
procession with its head near the chief marshal’s headquarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
which were located on the Samoset House lawn, marched
north to Lothrop street, then countermarching and proceeding
through Court, Main, Leyden, Water, Market, High, Summer
and Pleasant streets to the tent which was completely
filled, about seven hundred ladies having been admitted before
the arrival of the procession to seats on one side of each
table. The order of the procession was as follows: Escort,
Boston Brigade Band, The Standish Guards, Abington
Artillery, Samoset Guards, Halifax Light Infantry, Plymouth
Band, Chief Marshal and Aids. President and officers and
committee of arrangements of the Pilgrim Society, Governor
of Massachusetts and staff, attended by the Corps of Independent
cadets, and Adjutant General, South Abington band,
presidents of New England societies, and of the Cape Cod Association,
United States Senators, members of Congress, president
of the State Senate, United States District Attorney,
Attorney General of Massachusetts, invited guests, New England
Society of New York, attended by the New York Light
Guard and Dodworth’s band, Pilgrim Society, town officers,
clergy, school teachers, South Bridgewater band, and the
Plymouth fire department. At the President’s table sat at
his right and left Rev. Dr. James Kendall, Rev. Dr. George
W. Blagden, Hon. Edward Everett, Governor John H. Clifford,
Hon. Chas. H. Warren, Hon. Chas. Sumner, Hon. John
P. Hale, Hon. H. A. Scudder, Hon. Richard Yeadon, Hon.
Chas. W. Upham, Rev. Sam’l Osgood, Rev. Chas. S. Porter and
Hiram Fuller. The speeches were of a high order, elaborate
and eloquent. Governor Clifford in his speech rebuked the
reckless spirit which proclaims manifest destiny as our National
guide in the following words: “But what is the manifest
destiny doctrine of our day with which we are constantly stimulating
our national arrogance and self conceit?... I believe
the most recent and authoritative exposition of it is that it is
one of the inexorable conditions of our country’s existence,
“to march, march, march” in the path of Pagan Rome as restless
as the eternal tramp of the Wandering Jew ... till its
mission is accomplished. Sir, are we content to abide by the
example of our fathers? Which will you carry from this scene
of joyous festivity and pious commemoration—a prayer that
the forward march of the country you love, and in which your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
children are to live shall be symbolized by the Wandering
Jew or by the Christian Pilgrim.” Governor Clifford was
then forty-four years old, and consequently he was not uttering
the sentiments of over caution which sometimes characterize
old age. If any of my readers think that he was, they
will be pleased with the following eloquent passage in the
speech of Mr. Everett, which followed. In speaking of the
great work of the Pilgrims not yet finished he said: “The
work—the work must go on. It must reach at the North to
the enchanted cave of the magnet within never melting barriers
of Arctic ice; it must bow to the Lord of day on the altar
peaks of Chimborazo; it must look up and worship the
Southern cross. From the Eastern most cliff on the Atlantic
that blushes in the kindling dawn, to the last promontory on
the Pacific which receives the parting kiss of the setting sun
as he goes down to his pavilion of purple and gold it must
make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice in
the gladsome light of morals and letters and arts.” This was
a poetic sentiment of great beauty illustrating the art of eloquence
which Mr. Hale turned into ridicule in his later speech
when he said, “I find that the boldest tropes that ever rung
beneath the dome of your Federal capitol are tame to the conceptions
which have been poured forth from Pilgrim lips upon
Pilgrim ears today. We heard there of men whose powers of
digestion were so capacious that the idea of swallowing Mexico
at a meal did not alarm them. Today in the most eloquent
language we have had the genius of our country taking her
seat at the center of magnetic attraction swallowing Chimborazo
for supper, and kissing sunset with an affectionate embrace.”</p>

<p>The other speakers were Mr. Sumner, Dr. Blagden, Charles
W. Upham, Richard Yeadon, Henry A. Scudder, Rev. Samuel
Osgood and Hiram Fuller. In the evening there was a
brilliant display of fireworks, music by the Brigade band in
Town Square, and a reception at the house then occupied by
President Warren, now the home of Colonel Stoddard.</p>

<p>John Henry Clifford was born in Providence, January 16,
1809, and graduated at Brown in 1827. After studying law
he settled in New Bedford and began his public career as Representative
in 1835. He was Attorney General from 1849 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
1853, and from 1854 to 1858, having been chosen governor
in 1852. He received in 1849 from Harvard a degree of
LL. D., and died in New Bedford, January 2, 1876.</p>

<p>John Parker Hale was born in Rochester, N. H., March 31,
1806, and graduated at Bowdoin in 1827, and was admitted
to the bar in Dover and settled there. He was a representative
in 1832, and United States District Attorney from 1834
to 1841, member of Congress from 1843 to 1845. In 1846 he
was speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives
and United States Senator from 1847 to 1853, and from 1855
to 1865. He was minister to Spain from 1865 to 1869, and
candidate of the Liberty party for president in 1852. He
died in Dover, November 19, 1873.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner was born in Boston, January 6, 1811, and
graduated at Harvard in 1830. The only political office he
ever held was that of United States Senator, to which he was
chosen in 1851, remaining by successive elections in office until
his death, which occurred in Washington, March 11, 1874.</p>

<p>Charles Wentworth Upham, son of Joshua Upham, a noted
loyalist, was born in St. John, N. B., May 4, 1802, and graduated
at Harvard in 1821. In 1824 he was settled as colleague
pastor of Rev. John Prince of the First Church in
Salem. In 1844 he relinquished preaching on account of a
partial loss of voice, and thenceforth devoted himself to literature
and politics. In 1852 he was Mayor of Salem, and
after serving some years as Representative, was President of
the Senate in 1857 and 1858. He was a member of the State
Constitutional Convention in 1853; a member of Congress from
1853 to 1855, and died in Salem, June 14, 1875.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Osgood was born in Charlestown, August 30,
1812, and graduated at Harvard in 1832. After leaving the
Cambridge Divinity school in 1835 he was settled in Nashua,
N. H., in 1838, and in 1841 over the Westminster Unitarian
church in Providence. In 1849 he became pastor of the
Church of the Messiah, Unitarian, in New York, where he
remained until 1869. In 1870 he was ordained deacon in the
Episcopal church, and continued in that faith until his death,
April 14, 1880.</p>

<p>Hiram Fuller was born in Halifax, Mass., at a date unknown
by me, but probably about 1807. I remember hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
him say that the first time he ever came to Plymouth he rode
on a charcoal cart. He opened a private school in Plymouth
in 1832, keeping it at various times in Robbin’s Hall on
Middle street or Paine’s hall, as it was later called, and in Old
Colony Hall in the rear of the present market of C. B. Harlow.
He went from Plymouth to Providence about 1835 or
1836, where he taught school for a time, and afterwards opened
a bookstore. He went from Providence to New York,
where he became associated with N. P. Willis and George P.
Morris in the editorship of the <cite>New Mirror and Home
Journal</cite>, retaining his connections with those papers during
a period of fourteen years. Under the name of Belle Brittan
he published a volume of brilliant letters, and devoted much
of his time to miscellaneous literary labors. When the Civil
War came on his sympathies were enlisted in behalf of the
South, and finding New York an uncongenial residence, went
to England, where he remained until his death. At one time
he had an editorial connection in London, with a newspaper
called the <cite>Cosmopolitan</cite>, but I have reason to believe that the
issue of the war and the consequent loss of English interest
in the Confederate cause, left him stranded and reduced in
a foreign land.</p>

<p>In 1855 the anniversary of the Landing was celebrated on
the 22nd of December, on which occasion Hon. Wm. H. Seward
of Auburn, N. Y., delivered an oration in the First
Church. The incident which I remember more distinctly than
any other in connection with the oration, was Mr. Seward’s
lighting a cigar the moment the benediction was pronounced
as he stood on a raised platform in front of the pulpit. He
was a confirmed smoker, and like too many other confirmed
smokers of our day had little regard for the time and place
for the indulgence of his habit. The dinner was prepared
by J. B. Smith of Boston in Davis Hall, and Richard Warren,
president of the Pilgrim Society, presided. The speakers
were: Mr. Seward, Hon. George S. Boutwell, Rev. John S.
Barry, Wendell Phillips, Rev. Thomas D. Worrell of London,
Rev. Dr. George W. Briggs and Hon. B. F. Butler of New
York. The last named gentleman sharing with the Massachusetts
General a distinguished name, was born in Kinderhook,
N. Y., Dec. 15, 1795, and on his admission to the bar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
became in 1817 partner of Martin Van Buren. He was Attorney
General of the United States, under Andrew Jackson,
from 1831 to 1834, acting secretary of war under Van Buren,
and from 1838 to 1841, U. S. District Attorney for the Southern
District of New York. He died in Paris, France, Nov.
8, 1858.</p>

<p>William Henry Seward, the orator of the day, was born
in Florida, N. Y., May 16, 1801, and graduated at Union college
in 1820. He was admitted to the bar in 1822, and settled
in Auburn, and in 1830 was chosen State Senator on the
anti-masonic ticket. In 1838 he was chosen Governor, and
re-elected in 1840, and in 1849 was chosen U. S. Senator. In
1861 he was appointed by President Lincoln secretary of
state, and continued in office until the close of President Johnson’s
term. He died in Auburn, October 10, 1872.</p>

<p>In 1859, the necessary arrangements having been concluded
for beginning work on the canopy over the Rock and on the
National Monument, it was decided by the Pilgrim Society to
lay at once the corner stones of those structures with suitable
ceremonies. The anniversary of the embarkation was again
selected for celebrating the event, but as the first of August
would fall on Monday, it was thought best to have the celebration
on Tuesday, the second. The following committee of
arrangements was appointed, by whom I was again appointed
Chief Marshal, Richard Warren, Timothy Gordon, Wm. T.
Davis, Samuel H. Doten, Charles O. Churchill and George
G. Dyer. A committee on the ball was appointed, consisting
of Edward W. Russell, Edward B. Hayden, Charles C. Doten
of Plymouth, Austin C. Cushman of New Bedford, and Wm.
S. Huntington of North Bridgewater. The chief marshal
appointed as aids, Admiral P. Stone, Wm. Atwood, Samuel
H. Doten, Charles Raymond, Leavitt Finney, John H. Harlow
of Plymouth, James H. Beal of Boston, James Bates of
East Bridgewater. He also appointed twenty-eight assistant
marshals from Plymouth, and ten from other places.</p>

<p>The committee decided on the following plan for the celebration:
The laying of the cornerstone of the canopy by the
Masonic order; a procession; the laying of the cornerstone
of the National Monument with Masonic ceremonies; a dinner
provided by J. B. Smith of Boston in a tent, capable of
holding twenty-five hundred persons, pitched in the field below
the present store of Wm. Burn’s, now occupied by three
dwelling houses, owned by Mr. Emery; fireworks, and a ball
in the evening in Davis Hall. At ten o’clock a Masonic procession
was formed on Main street, consisting of the Massachusetts,
Boston and DeMoley encampments of Knights
Templar, under command of John T. Heard, and marched
to the Rock, where addresses were made by President Warren
and Mr. Heard, and a hymn was sung, composed by John
Shepard. At half past eleven the grand procession, whose
various divisions had been forming while the ceremony at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
Rock was going on, started from the headquarters of the
chief marshal near the Samoset House, and proceeded through
Court, Main, Market, High, Summer, Pleasant, Green, Sandwich,
Market, Leyden, Water, North, Court and Cushman
streets to Monument hill. The procession marched in the following
order: Mounted police, Boston brigade band, Standish
Guards, New Bedford City Guards, Braintree Light Infantry,
So. Abington Infantry, New Bedford brass band, chief marshal
and aids mounted, president of the Pilgrim Society and
invited guests, St. Paul’s lodge of South Boston, lodge of
Cambridge, Liberty lodge of New Bedford, Star of the East
lodge of New Bedford, King Solomon lodge of Charlestown,
Boston brass band, Washington lodge of Roxbury, the Plymouth
lodge, Plymouth brass band, Royal Arch chapter of New
Bedford, Boston encampment of Knights Templar, Royal
Arch Chapter of South Abington, South Abington band, DeMoley
encampment, Grand lodge of Massachusetts, American
brass band, Odd Fellows, New England Society of New
York, Massachusetts Historical Society, American Antiquarian
Society, Historic Genealogical Society, Cape Cod Association,
Finney’s band, Plymouth Fire Department, Campello Engine
company, North Bridgewater band, and six groups on flats representing
the Landing, Indians, advance of civilization, the
thirty-three states, different nations, and the marine interests
of Plymouth.</p>

<p>After addresses at the monument by President Warren, and
the ceremony of laying the cornerstone, conducted by the
Grandmaster, John T. Heard, the invited guests were escorted
to the dining tent, where Rev. Edward H. Hall, pastor of the
First Church asked a blessing. Besides the president the
speakers were, Gov. Banks, Salmon P. Chase, Wm. Maxwell
Evarts, Gov. Buckingham of Conn., John P. Hale, Francis
P. Bair, Jr., Anson Burlingame, Gov. Kent of Maine, George
Sumner and Rev. Mr. Waddington of Southwark, London.

County, in 1829 was chosen Mayor of Bangor, and was Governor
from 1838 to 1840. He was made U. S. Consul at Rio
by President Taylor, and in 1859 Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. He died in Bangor, May 19, 1877.</p>

<p>William Alfred Buckingham, born in Lebanon, Conn., May
28, 1804, was a merchant and manufacturer, and Governor
of Connecticut from 1858 to 1866, and in 1869 was chosen
U. S. Senator. He died in Norwich, February 3, 1875.</p>

<p>Anson Burlingame was born in New Berlin, N. Y., Nov.

Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in 1853, and member
of Congress from 1856 to 1861, in which latter year he
was appointed minister to Austria. From 1861 to 1867 he
was minister to China, and while in the service of China, died
in St. Petersburg, February 23, 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span></p>

<p>George Sumner was a brother of Charles Sumner, born in
Boston, February 5, 1817, where he died October 6, 1863.
He published memoirs of the Pilgrims in Leyden, and delivered
the Fourth of July oration in Boston in 1859.</p>

<p>Francis P. Blair, Jr., son of Francis Preston Blair, and
brother of Montgomery Blair, was born in Lexington, Ky.,
February 19, 1821, and graduated at Princeton in 1841. He
studied law and began practice in St. Louis. During the Mexican
war he enlisted as private and served until 1847, when
he returned to St. Louis and resumed practice. In 1848 he
was a Free Soiler, and edited the <cite>Missouri Democrat</cite>. In
1852 and 1854 he was a member of the Missouri Legislature,
and in 1856 was chosen member of Congress, and again in
1860 and 1862. He was commissioned Colonel in the army in
1861, and Brigadier General and Major General in 1862. In
1866 he was appointed Collector of Customs at St. Louis.
In 1868 he was the candidate of the Democratic party for Vice-President.
In 1870 he was chosen U. S. Senator from Missouri,
and died in St. Louis, July 8, 1875.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Society voted to celebrate the 250th anniversary
of the Landing of the Pilgrims on the 21st of December, and
to establish that day for the first time and forever as the true
day, instead of the 22d. Without entering upon any detailed
explanation of the error leading to the observance of the 22d,
it is sufficient to say that in 1620 the difference between the
Julian calendar, and the Gregorian calendar, now used, was
ten days, and that consequently an almanac made up in accordance
with the latter, would have marked the 11th of December
the day of the Landing, as the 21st. It follows, of
course, that what was then the Gregorian 21st, must be the
21st for all coming time.</p>

<p>I was then Vice-President of the Pilgrim Society, and at
a meeting of the trustees held on the 7th of September, it was
voted that the committee of arrangements for the celebration
be appointed, of which the Vice-President should be chairman.
The committee as appointed consisted of Wm. T. Davis, Wm.
H. Whitman, Eleazer C. Sherman, Charles G. Davis and Wm.
S. Danforth, by whom subsequently the following additional
members were appointed, John Morissey, Albert Mason,
Samuel H. Doten, Nathaniel Brown of Plymouth, Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
Russell and George P. Hayward of Boston, and Richard Warren
of New York. Albert Mason was appointed chief
marshal, and Wm. S. Danforth, treasurer. A finance committee
was also appointed, and to the committee of arrangements
as managers of the ball, the following honorary managers
were added, Richard Warren of New York, Thomas
Russell, Wm. G. Russell, James T. Hayward, Benjamin W.
Harris of Boston, James H. Harlow of Middleboro, James
H. Mitchell of East Bridgewater, Wm. Savery of Carver,
Wm. L. Reed of Abington, George W. Wright of Duxbury,
C. B. H. Fessenden of New Bedford, and Charles F. Swift
of Yarmouth. The following were selected as floor managers,
Henry G. Parker of Boston, Dwight Faulkner, Francis
H. Russell, B. M. Watson, Jr., Benjamin O. Strong, Wm.
P. Stoddard, James D. Thurber, Robert B. Churchill, Edward
W. Russell and Isaac Damon.</p>

<p>The committee of arrangements voted to have a public dinner
in the Old Colony Railroad station, the use of which had
been tendered for the purpose, and that L. E. Field of Taunton
be engaged to furnish both the dinner, and the supper
at the ball. The Standish Guards were invited to perform
escort duty, as the guests of the Society, and Gilmore’s band
of Boston, and the Plymouth brass band were engaged for the
occasion. At an early meeting of the trustees of the society
held before any arrangements had been entered upon, it was
voted to invite Hon. Robert C. Winthrop to deliver an oration,
and it was after his acceptance that the plans for the celebration
were perfected. A large number of guests were invited
to attend the celebration, including one hundred and twenty-two
men of distinction, and fourteen historical, and New England
Societies, but it is only necessary to mention those who
were present. At eleven o’clock a procession was formed at
Pilgrim Hall, under the direction of Albert Mason, chief
marshal, assisted by his aids, Capt. Charles C. Doten and
Major James D. Thurber, and by twelve marshals, and under
escort of the Standish Guards, and with the music of the
Plymouth brass band, and Gilmore’s band of Boston, marched
through Court, North and Leyden streets to the First Church.
As it passed Plymouth Rock a National salute was fired on
board the U. S. Revenue Cutter Mahoning, Capt. R. A. Fengar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
who was a guest of the society. Seats reserved for ladies
in the church were occupied previous to the arrival of the procession,
and seats reserved for the press were occupied by
representatives of two Plymouth journals, one Abington, one
Hingham, one North Bridgewater, one Middleboro, one New
Bedford, one Weymouth, one Yarmouth, one Northampton,
one Hartford, one Chicago, one Mexico, N. Y., three New
York, and nine Boston.</p>

<p>The services in the church were as follows: Voluntary,
prayer from “Moses in Egypt,” by Gilmore’s band, ode,
“Sons of Renowned Sires”; scriptures read by Rev. Dr. Frederic
H. Hedge; hymn; oration; prayer, by Rev. Dr. Joseph P.
Thompson of New York; hymn; benediction, by Rev. Frederic
N. Knapp; voluntary, “Selection from Il Trovatore,” by
Gilmore’s band. The choir was a double quartette, consisting
of Mrs. Winslow B. Standish and Miss Olive M. Collingwood,
sopranos; Mrs. E. W. Atwood and Miss Lina Rich, contraltos;
Joseph L. Brown and Dr. Thomas B. Drew, tenors;
Chas. H. Richardson and James M. Atwood, bassos.</p>

<p>In arranging for the celebration, Hon. Edward S. Toby,
president of the Pilgrim Society, stated to the committee that
he should be necessarily absent during most of the time at the
dinner, and I, as vice president, consequently presided in his
place. After my opening address, the following gentlemen
made speeches: Hon. Edward S. Tobey, Major General O.
O. Howard, Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, Hon. Henry Wilson,
Hon. George S. Hillard, Hon. John H. Clifford, Rev. Joseph
P. Thompson, Hon. Charles S. Bradley, Hon. Marshal P.
Wilder, Hon. Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, Hon. T. Sterry Hunt,
and Hon. George T. Davis. Mr. Clifford spoke as chairman
of the board of overseers of Harvard, Mr. Shurtleff as Mayor
of Boston, Mr. Bradley as Chief Justice of the Rhode Island
Supreme Court, and Mr. Hunt as President of the Montreal
New England Society. Mingled with the speeches, was a
poem read by Mr. William Everett. In the evening a brilliant
ball was held in Davis Hall.</p>

<p>Hon. Robert Charles Winthrop, son of Thomas Lindall
and Elizabeth (Bowdoin) Winthrop was born in Boston, May
12, 1809, and graduated from Harvard in 1828. His father
was Lieut. Governor of Massachusetts from 1826 to 1833.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
He studied law with Daniel Webster, and was admitted to
the Boston bar in 1831. He was a member of the legislature
from 1835 to 1840, being speaker of the House of Representatives
the last two years. He was a member of Congress
from 1840 to 1842, and from 1844 to 1850, serving two years
as speaker. When Daniel Webster left the Senate to become
secretary of state in 1850, he was appointed to fill out his
term. In 1851 he was the Whig candidate for Governor, and
though receiving a plurality vote, failed to receive a majority,
as then required by the law. The election then went to the
legislature, and George S. Boutwell was chosen. He published
the “Life and Letters of Gov. John Winthrop,” and delivered
many speeches and orations, which have been published
in a book form, the most notable of which were his Pilgrim
oration of Plymouth in 1870, and his oration on the Anniversary
of the surrender of Cornwallis in 1881. He died in
Boston, November 16, 1894.</p>

<p>Rev. Joseph Parrish Thompson was born in Philadelphia,
August 7, 1819, and graduated at Yale in 1838. He became
pastor of the Chapel street church in New Haven in 1840, and
from 1845 to was pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle
in New York. He was a prolific writer, and in 1856 received
from Harvard the Degree of Doctor of Divinity, and died in
Berlin, Sept. 21, 1879.</p>

<p>Major General Oliver Otis Howard was born in Leeds,
Me., Nov. 8, 1830, and graduated at Bowdoin in 1850, and
at West Point in 1854. In 1861 he was Colonel of a Maine
Regiment, and commanded a brigade at Bull Run. He was
made a Brigadier General in 1862, and lost his right arm at
Fair Oaks. After the battle of Antietam he commanded a
division, and was made Major General of volunteers Nov. 29,
1862. On the 27th of July, 1864, he took command of the
army of the Tennessee, and commanded the right wing of
Sherman’s army in his march to the sea. He was appointed
brigadier general on Dec. 21, 1864, and brevet major general,
March 13, 1865, and is still living.</p>

<p>Thomas Sterry Hunt was born in Norwich, Conn., September
5, 1826, and after studying medicine was in 1845, a
student in chemistry with Prof. Benjamin Silliman, Jr., in
New Haven, and later his assistant in the Yale laboratory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
In 1847 he was made chemist and mineralogist to the geological
survey of Canada, and held that position until his resignation
in 1872. After retiring from his position in Canada,
he succeeded Prof. Wm. B. Rogers in the chair of geology in
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He published in
1874 a volume containing his collected scientific essays, and
received from Harvard the honorary degree of LL. D., and
of Sc. D. from the Universities of Montreal and Quebec.
He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of London in
1859, and of the National Academy of the United States in
1873, receiving also an appointment as officer in the French
order of the legion of honor. He died in New York, Feb.
12, 1892.</p>

<p>Hon. Henry Wilson was born in Farmington, N. H., Feb.
16, 1812. In 1829 he was authorized by the New Hampshire
legislature to change his original name of Jones Colbath to
that by which he was known through his public life. From
1822 to 1833 he was employed by a farmer in his native town,
during which time he received only twelve months’ schooling.
About 1833 he walked from Farmington to Natick, Mass.,
where he worked as shoemaker two years, and then returning
to New Hampshire attended the academies at Stafford,
Wolfeboro and Concord. In 1838 he returned to Natick and
continuing shoemaking, entered politics in 1840, as a stump
speaker in behalf of Harrison for President. He was three
years a representative from Natick, and a state senator in 1850
and 1851, and president of the senate. He was a member of the
state constitutional convention in 1853, and in 1855 was chosen
U. S. Senator, and by re-election continued in that office until
he was chosen vice-president of the United States in 1872,
and died in Washington, Nov. 22, 1875.</p>

<p>George Stillman Hillard was born in Machias, Me., Sept.
22, 1808, and graduated at Harvard in 1828. He was admitted
to the bar in Boston in 1833, and mingled with his professional
labors literary pursuits. He was United States District
Attorney from 1867 to 1870, and died in Boston, January
21, 1879.</p>

<p>Dr. Nathaniel Bradstreet Shurtleff was born in Boston,
June 29, 1810, and graduated at Harvard in 1831. His father
born in Carver, Mass., studied medicine with Dr. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
Thacher of Plymouth, and settled in Boston. Dr. Nathaniel
Bradstreet of Newburyport was a fellow student, and for
him Dr. Benjamin Shurtleff named his son. The son abandoned
practice and devoted himself to historic pursuits. He
was a prolific writer, and one of his most important works
was a topographical History of Boston. He also edited the
publication of the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Records,
and was mayor of Boston in 1768-’69-’70. He died in
Boston, October 17, 1874.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim Society again celebrated the anniversary of the
Landing, on Wednesday the 21st of December, 1880. No attempt
at display was made, and the observance was largely a
domestic one. A simple service was held in the First Church,
followed by a dinner in Davis Hall, furnished by George E.
Patterson of Boston.</p>

<p>Thomas Russell, president of the Society, presided, and
speeches were made by Hon. John D. Long, Hon. Alexander
H. Rice, Hon. Thomas D. Eliot, Rev. Dr. McKensie, General
Armstrong of Hampton College, President Drehan of Roanoke
College, and Rev. Dr. Geo. W. Briggs. The next celebration
held on Monday, December 21, 1885, was of the same
character. A service was held in the church, and a dinner in
Davis Hall, at which Thomas Russell, President of the Society
presided. The other speakers were: Rev. Dr. George E.
Ellis, James Russell Lowell, Rev. Dr. Henry M. Dexter, Hon.
Charles L. Woodbury, Hon. Oliver Ames, Rev. Dr. J. T. Duryea,
Rev. Adoniram J. Gordon, Rev. Dr. Brooke Hereford,
Justin Winsor and Rev. Dr. A. A. Miner.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the trustees of the Pilgrim Society held
March 23, 1889, a committee of twelve was appointed to
make arrangements for a celebration of the completion of the
National Monument on the first of August. The committee
consisted of John D. Long, President of the Society, and Wm.
T. Davis, Wm. S. Danforth, Charles G. Davis, Wm. H. Nelson,
James D. Thurber, Charles C. Doten, James B. Brewster,
Arthur Lord, Daniel E. Damon, Wm. Hedge and Winslow
Warren. At a town meeting held April 2, the sum of $1,500
was appropriated in aid of the celebration, and it was voted
that the Board of selectmen be joined to the committee of
arrangements in the expenditure of the money. As Mr. Nelson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
and myself were already members of the committee, the
other three members of the board, Everett F. Sherman,
Leavitt T. Robbins and Alonzo Warren were added. At a
meeting of the committee it was voted as the president would
be unable to attend its meetings, that Wm. T. Davis be appointed
vice chairman. At a subsequent meeting it was voted
that the celebration consist of a procession and dinner and ball.
Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge of Lexington, Kentucky, was invited
to deliver an oration, and John Boyle O’Reilly of Boston
to deliver a poem, and both accepted. Myron W. Whitney
was also invited to be a guest of the Society, and to sing
the ode of Mrs. Heman’s. Col. Wm. P. Stoddard was appointed
Chief Marshal who subsequently appointed Major
George B. Russell, U. S. A., chief of staff, and Dr. James B.
Brewster, Capt. Andrew H. Russell, U. S. A., William H.
Drew, Dr. Warren Peirce, Wm. Hedge, Albert E. Davis and
Elmer E. Sherman, marshals of divisions. Other marshals
appointed were, George L. Osgood, George Russell Briggs,
Dr. H. F. Copeland, Arthur Braman, H. L. Hayden, S. L.
Parks, Isaac S. Brewster, Dr. Edgar D. Hill, Henry A. Atwood,
Wm. F. Atwood, Capt. James L. Hall, Charles S.
Davis, Col. Benjamin S. Lovell, Capt. James D. Thurber, D.
Clifton Freeman, Charles A. Strong, Frank H. Holmes,
Henry H. Fowler, Edward Manter, Joseph T. Collingwood,
John W. Herrick and C. E. Small.</p>

<p>Other committees were appointed consisting of a committee
on transportation, committee on decorations, committee
on fireworks, committee on the dinner, committee of reception
and committee on the ball, the last consisting of Wm. Hedge,
George B. Russell, Howland Davis, Thomas Russell, Richard
H. Morgan, Benjamin M. Watson, Jr., Charles S. Davis, Edwin
S. Damon, Alfred S. Burbank, Wm. B. Thurber, Edward
S. Emery, Henry H. Fowler, Joseph T. Collingwood, James
Mullins, George R. Briggs, Harold Whiting and Charles B.
Stoddard. Invitations were sent to the various Plymouth
organizations of Masons, Odd Fellows, Standish Guards,
Good Fellows, Pilgrim Fathers, Iron Hall, Good Templars,
Royal Arcanum and the Fire Department, and liberal appropriations
were made by the committee to enable them to entertain
guests. The Independent Corps of Cadets of Boston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
and Battery A of Boston were invited to participate in the
parade and accepted. A contract was made with A. Erickson
of Boston for a tent two hundred and fifty feet long and
eighty feet wide, which was pitched in the meadow between
the house of Mrs. J. R. Lothrop and Water street, and arrangements
were made with Harvey Blunt of Boston and
David H. Maynard of Plymouth to furnish the dinner, and
also the supper for the ball. It is unnecessary to mention
the various associations and guests invited by the committee,
but, including Masonic bodies, Odd Fellows, Military Companies
and associations and individuals, they numbered about
one hundred and fifty. It was arranged that a salute should
be fired by Battery A at six o’clock a. m., and that at 9.30 a.
m. the M. W. Grand Lodge should dedicate the monument,
and that at 11 o’clock the procession should proceed through
Court, Allerton, Cushman, Court, North, Water, Leyden,
Market, Summer, High, Russell, Court, Brewster,
Water, North, Main, Market, Pleasant, South Sandwich
and Water, streets to the tent. From three to five
o’clock it was arranged to have concerts in Shirley
Square by the Lynn Cadet Band, on Training Green by the
Plymouth Rock Band, on Cole’s Hill by the Silver Fife and
Drum Corps, and on the Samoset lawn by Lindall’s band.
The fireworks were planned for Monument hill, an electric illumination
of the Monument, and a concert in Shirley Square
from nine to ten by the Plymouth Band. With a ball in the
Armory with music furnished by the Germania Band of Boston,
seventeen pieces, the festivities were to close.</p>

<p>The order of the procession is too long to include in this
narrative. It is sufficient to say that it included three companies
of Infantry, Battery A, twelve bands, five Grand Army
Posts, delegations from ten societies and associations, five
commanderies of Masons, ten Masonic Lodges, two Encampments
of Odd Fellows, six lodges of Odd Fellows, and three
Fire Departments. It was planned that the seventh division
of the procession, composed of five hundred school children,
should be seated on the slope of Cole’s Hill, and join in singing
appropriate hymns, while the procession passed.</p>

<p>The dinner tent holding two thousand, was full to the last
seat. Governor John D. Long, the president of the Pilgrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
Society, had on his right Lieut. Governor Brackett, Adjt.
General Samuel Dalton, John Boyle O’Reilly, Grand Master
Henry Endicott, Hon. Wm. Cogswell, Hon. Frederic T.
Greenhalge, Hon. Charles S. Randall, Hon. Wm. G. Russell,
Hon. Wirt Dexter, Wm. T. Davis and Myron W. Whitney,
Esq., and on his left, Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, Hon. Geo.
F. Hoar, Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, Hon. John W. Candler,
Hon. Elijah A. Morse, Hon. Henry B. Pierce, Hon. Wm.
W. Crapo, Roland Mather, Esq., Rev. Joseph H. Twichell of
Hartford, Hon. William E. Barrett and Hon. Charles F.
Choate. Among others seated on the platform were the
Mayor of Boston, the Mayor of Brockton, the chairmen of
the Boards of Selectmen of Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury
and Plympton, Rev. Samuel Hopkins Emery of Taunton,
Hon. Stephen Salisbury of Worcester, Hon. John Winslow of
Brooklyn, Justin Winsor, Abner C. Goodell, Samuel C. Cobb,
Hon. John E. Russell, Hon. Albert Mason, Prof. Lemuel
Stephens, Prof. E. N. Horsford, Lt. Col. Thomas F. Edmunds,
Major Dexter H. Follett, Lt. Frederick I. Clayton,
Francis Bartlett, Esq., and Rev. Charles P. Lombard. A
blessing was asked by Mr. Lombard, and after an opening
address by Hon. John D. Long, President of the Pilgrim Society,
the oration by Mr. Breckinridge, and the poem by John
Boyle O’Reilly followed. After the poem an address of welcome
was made by myself, which was followed by speeches by
Lt. Gov. J. Q. A. Brackett, Hon. George F. Hoar, Hon. Henry
Cabot Lodge, Hon. Wm. Cogswell, Hon. Elijah A. Morse,
Hon. Frederick T. Greenhalge, and by the singing of “Breaking
Waves Dashed High” by Myron W. Whitney, Esq., and
by a musical selection rendered by the Temple Quartette Club
of Boston. The decorations along the route of the procession
exceeded in appropriateness and good taste any ever before
seen in Plymouth, and the five arches on Court, North, Leyden,
Summer and Pleasant streets were pronounced by competent
critics as models in proportion and adornment. The
press was represented on the occasion by two members from
Plymouth, one from Brockton, one from Burlington, Vt., one
from Troy, ten from Boston, five from New York, and by the
Associated Press. The number of visitors was estimated at
fifteen thousand, and as compared with the celebrations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
1853 and 1859, was from three to five thousand larger than
that at either.</p>

<p>In writing chapters of Plymouth memories it seems unnecessary
to include a celebration as recent as that in 1895,
but a complete record of the observances conducted by the
Pilgrim Society may aid future historic explorers and writers.
In the above year the Society held its celebration on the
21st of December. Arthur Lord was then President of the
Society, and he and Wm. T. Davis, James D. Thurber, Wm.
S. Danforth, Charles C. Doten, Charles B. Stoddard and Gideon
F. Holmes, were appointed a committee of arrangements.
Col. Wm. P. Stoddard was appointed Chief Marshal, with
Winslow B. Standish and Wm. Hedge as aids, and a committee
on the ball was appointed, consisting of Edgar D. Hill,
Charles A. Strong, James Spooner, Henry J. W. Drew, Alfred
S. Burbank, W. C. Butler, A. E. Lewis and E. A. Dunton.
Hon. Geo. F. Hoar and Richard Henry Stoddard, who
had been invited to deliver respectively an oration and poem,
accepted their invitations. The Society met at Pilgrim Hall,
and with the orator and poet and invited guests proceeded to
the Armory, where exercises were held, consisting of an overture
by the Plymouth Band, anthem by the Plymouth Musical
Club, prayer by Rev. Charles P. Lombard, ode, “Sons of
Renowned Sires,” poem by Richard Henry Stoddard, ode,
“Breaking Waves Dashed High,” sung by Myron W. Whitney,
oration by Hon. Geo. F. Hoar, ode, “The Pilgrim Fathers
Where are They,” benediction by Rev. Ernest W. Shurtleff.</p>

<p>The trustees of the Society, with the chief marshal and aids
and members of committees and guests dined at the Samoset
House, where speeches were made by Lt. Gov. Roger Wolcott,
Hon. Winslow Warren, Hon. Samuel R. Thayer, and Hon.
Robert S. Rantoul, and the dinner closed with a song sung by
Myron W. Whitney.</p>

<p>In addition to the above the anniversary of the Landing
was celebrated by the Plymouth Fire Department, Dec. 21,
1886, by a procession, dinner and a ball, at which the Boston
Cadet band furnished the music. John C. Cave and Henry
Harlow were chairman and secretary of the committee of arrangements,
and I was invited to preside. After my address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
speeches were made by Chas. H. Howland, Chas. G. Davis,
Rev. F. N. Knapp, Rev. W. P. Burnell, Daniel E. Damon,
Albert E. Davis. Wm. H. Nelson, James Morton, John C.
Ross, Edward B. Atwood. Other celebrations not already
mentioned in these memories have been the following, of
which I have space for only superficial notices. The Fourth
of July, 1825, was celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth.
Hon. Wm. Davis presided, assisted by Joseph Thomas, Coomer
Weston, Pelham W. Warren, Bridgham Russell, Joseph
Allen, and Samuel Doten, vice presidents, and an oration was
delivered in the First Church by Wm. Thomas, Esq., of Plymouth.
In 1826 the Fourth of July was again celebrated.
Hon. John Thomas of Kingston presided, and an oration was
delivered by Hon. Charles Henry Warren of New Bedford,
a native of Plymouth. A ball in Pilgrim Hall closed the observance
of the day. The Fourth of July, 1828, was again
celebrated by citizens, with Hon. Nathaniel M. Davis president
of the day, assisted by Nathan Hayward, Ezra Finney,
Abraham Jackson, Isaac L. Hedge, James G. Gleason of
Plymouth and Jonathan Parker of Plympton. Hon. John
A. Shaw of Bridgewater delivered an oration, and a dinner
and ball were held in Pilgrim Hall. In 1832 Washington’s
birthday was celebrated with an oration by Hon. Solomon
Lincoln of Hingham. Capt. Samuel Doten was chief marshal,
and Hon. Isaac L. Hedge was president of the day, assisted
by Jacob H. Loud, Nathaniel Wood, Thos. Paty and
John Bartlett as vice presidents. In 1865, Independence day
was celebrated by the citizens, the features of the celebration
being morning salutes, the ringing of bells, and a march of the
ancient and horribles, followed by a procession, and an oration
by Rev. George H. Hepworth of Boston. Hon. Jacob
H. Loud presided, and Thomas Loring was chief marshal, assisted
by John T. Stoddard and Albert Hedge as aids, and
Barnabas Hedge, George G. Dyer, Thomas Pierce, Warren
Macomber, Frederic W. Robbins, Charles Burton, George L.
Baxter, B. H. Holmes, T. B. Atwood, Aaron Cornish, Gustavus
D. Bates and Nathaniel C. Lanman, marshals. Among
the features of the procession were the Plymouth Lodge of
Masons, the Mayflower Lodge of Odd Fellows, a car of liberty,
and the army and navy, represented by Ignatius Pierce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
Jr., M. A. Diaz, Jr., Wm. W. Brewster and Herbert Morissey,
and five hundred public school scholars. The services were
held on the grounds of the Samoset House, and at their close
the scholars enjoyed a collation at Goddard’s grove, the general
public in Samoset house orchard, the Odd Fellows at Pilgrim
Hall, and the Masons at the Winslow House on Winslow
street.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, 1869, the dedication of the Soldiers’
monument on Training Green, was celebrated under the direction
of the Soldiers’ Monument Association. As President
of the Association I presided at the ceremonies. A large
tent was erected around and over the monument, and there
after my own address, an oration was delivered by Hon. Joshua
L. Chamberlain of Maine. Hon. John Morissey was chief
marshal, assisted by Albert Mason and Charles H. Drew as
aids, and the following marshals of divisions, Charles Raymond,
James D. Thurber, Charles B. Stoddard, Alvin Finney,
Henry W. Loring, Thomas B. Atwood, assisted by Wm. E.
Barnes, Elkanah C. Finney, Stephen C. Drew, B. A. Hathaway,
George Finney, Charles Mason, J. Frank Churchill, A.
Merritt Shaw, Robert B. Churchill and Alexander Atwood.
Among the invited guests present were: Governor Claflin of
Massachusetts, Governor Stearns of New Hampshire, Lt. Gov.
Tucker of Massachusetts, Hon. James Buffington, Thos. Russell,
General Benham and members of the executive council.
Among the associations were Collingwood Post G. A. R., the
McPherson Post, the Old Colony Encampment of K. T., the
Samoset Chapter of Masons, the Mayflower Lodge of Odd
Fellows, the Bay State Lodge of Lynn, the Palestine Encampment
of Lynn, and the Fire Department. The Standish
Guards and the Bay State Guards of Carver performed escort,
and the music was furnished by the North Bridgewater
Band, the Weymouth Band, the Abington Band, the Lynn
Band, and the Plymouth Band.</p>

<p>The reception at Plymouth of Louis Kossuth, May 12, 1852,
though not a celebration, may properly be recorded here. The
committee of arrangements were Capt. John Russell, Andrew
L. Russell, E. C. Sherman and Moses Bates, and Mr. Bates
presided with John D. Churchill, chief marshal. At a dinner
at the Samoset House, after the address made by Kossuth in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
the First Church, speeches were made by Mr. Bates, Gov.
George S. Boutwell, Stephen H. Phillips, and by M. Pulzzly
and M. Kocielski.</p>

<p>There was a celebration in 1849, which though not a public
one, I may be permitted to include in my narrative. A party
of gentlemen, all of whom were special friends of Daniel
Webster, came to Plymouth and dined at the Samoset on the
anniversary of the departure of the Pilgrims from Old Plymouth.
The departure occurred on the 16th of September, but
as that day in 1849 fell on Sunday, Monday was the day of
the dinner. The dinner was proposed by Mr. Webster, and
he presided. The occasion was a memorable one, including
among its guests leading professional and business men of
Boston, New York, Providence and New Bedford. At that
time I was living in Boston, and through the kindness of my
uncle, Chas. Henry Warren, who made up the party, I attended
the dinner, the youngest man at the table, and now the
only one living. Such men as Josiah Quincy, Rufus Choate,
Edward Everett, John H. Clifford, George S. Hillard, Benjamin
R. Curtis, Sidney Bartlett and Nathan Appleton were
there renewing allegiance to him from whom some had been
alienated by his patriotic refusal to leave the cabinet of John
Tyler, and others by his reluctant support of the nomination
of Zachary Taylor for the presidency. Mr. Webster’s speech
was eloquent and pathetic, feeling as he did, with the increasing
infirmities of age, that it might be the last time he should
address those who had put their trust in him, and on whom he
had leaned for support. It was my privilege to hear Mr.
Webster probably more times than any man now living, and
of the thirteen speeches I have heard from his lips, this was
the most tender and eloquent. Nathaniel P. Willis, in a letter
to his journal in New York said in describing it, that, “it
was the most beautiful example of manly pathos of which language
and looks could be capable. No one who heard it
could doubt the existence of a deep well of tears under that
lofty temple of intellect and power.”</p>

<p>Before closing the account of celebrations I ought to say
that the old Standish Guards, which was organized in 1818,
made its first public parade as an escort to the procession on
the 22d of December in the above year. They continued to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
perform escort duty at the Pilgrim celebrations until they
were disbanded in 1883. After the change was made in
1870 of the celebrations from the 22d to the 21st of December,
the company continued its celebration, not of the anniversary
of the Landing, but of the anniversary of the company’s first
public parade. From 1883 to 1888, there was no military
company in Plymouth, but in the latter year the present company
was chartered, not as Co. B, third Regiment, like the old
company, but as Co. D, 5th Regiment, having no more connection
with the old Standish Guards than the present Old Colony
Club on Court street has with the Old Colony Club which was
organized in 1768, and went out of existence at the beginning of
the Revolution. There seems, therefore, to be no reason why
the present company should keep up the observance of a day
with which it has no connection, as the 22d of December is
neither the anniversary of the landing, nor of its first public
parade, which occurred in 1888, and not in 1818.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>In my memories of the Civil War I shall confine myself as
closely as possible to events which I saw, and in an humble
way, a part of which I was. When on the 18th of April,
1861, the train bearing the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment to
Washington, halted at the Trenton station in New Jersey, the
Governor of that state walking in a thoughtful mood up and
down the platform, was asked by a friend, what he was thinking
about. He replied, “I am thinking about that damned
little state of Massachusetts. Here she is two days after the
call for troops, with seven states between her and Washington,
half way to that city with a full regiment armed and
equipped, bearing the first relief to our beleaguered capital.
How could she do it?” My answer to the Governor’s question
is that Massachusetts had an executive who knew how to
do things, and a people accustomed to take the initiative in
important emergencies. Governor John A. Andrew was inaugurated
on the 5th of January, 1861, and before he slept
that night he despatched confidential messages to the Governors
of the other New England states urging preparations
for the crisis, which he believed to be impending. Realizing
also that the 8th of January would be the anniversary of Andrew
Jackson’s victory in the battle of New Orleans, though
Massachusetts had not been in the habit of celebrating that
day, he seized the opportunity to arouse the spirit of patriotism
among the people and ordered a hundred guns to be fired
on the noon of the 8th on Boston Common, and national salutes
to be fired in Charlestown, Lexington, Concord, Waltham,
Roxbury, Marblehead, Newburyport, Salem, Groton,
Lynn, Worcester, Greenfield, Northampton, Fall River and
Lowell. The guns fired on that day were the first guns of
the war, and, as a note of defiance to South Carolina, which
had voted itself out of the Union, they sent a thrill through
every loyal heart, and turned the minds of the people into
channels to be gradually familiarized with thoughts of war.
On the 16th of January, eleven days after the inauguration,
he directed the promulgation of an order requiring the commanders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
of all volunteer militia companies to take immediate
steps to fill their ranks with men ready to respond to the call
of the commander-in-chief, discharging any who were not so
ready, and supplying their places with those who were. At
a later date the Governor by contracts afterwards confirmed
by the legislature, ordered six thousand yards of cloth, a yard
and a half wide at $1.37 per yard, two thousand military overcoats
at $2.15 each, two thousand knapsacks of the army pattern
at $1.88 each, one thousand pairs of blankets at $3.75 a
pair, two thousand haversacks at 75 cents each, coat buttons
costing $740, two hundred thousand ball cartridges at $14 a
thousand, and three hundred thousand percussion caps. The
legislature adjourned on the 11th of April, having appropriated
one hundred thousand dollars as an emergency fund,
twenty-five thousand dollars for overcoats and equipage, and
having so far amended the existing militia law which limited
the active militia to five thousand men, as to give the Governor
authority to organize as many companies and regiments
as the public exigency might require. Such, your Excellency,
the Governor of New Jersey, was the condition of
Massachusetts, when the first call for troops was made on the
15th of April, and thus is your question answered. Massachusetts
was ready with her toe on the line when the call to
arms was sounded.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April, Company B, 3rd Regiment, the Standish
Guards of Plymouth, was without a captain. Charles C.
Doten, 1st Lieutenant in command, was at that time in
charge of the telegraph office, in the rooms now occupied by
Mr. Loring’s watchmaker’s-shop on Main street. In the early
evening of that day he received a despatch from David W.
Wardrop of New Bedford, Colonel of the Third Regiment,
ordering him to report with his company to him on Boston
Common the next forenoon. A messenger bearing an official
order reached Plymouth during the night. The news
of the order spread like the wind through every street, and
into every house and home. The excitement was intense.
Every store was vacated by its loungers, every meeting was
dissolved, and every family circle gathered around the evening
lamp was broken up, and the armory of the Guards in
Union Building on the corner of Main and Middle streets, became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
at once the meeting place of the citizens. One after
another of the members of the company who were accessible,
reported himself, every man ready to respond to the call. As
chairman of the Board of Selectmen I gave the men assurances,
which were reinforced by prominent citizens, that their
families would be provided for during their absence, and ready
hands were offered to take up and finish any work which they
might leave uncompleted. The call was for three months’
service, and at nine o’clock the next morning nineteen members
of the Company marched to the station, escorted by a
large procession of citizens, and embarked for Boston. With
the addition of two members joining at Abington, and two
others joining in Boston, the company was quartered that
night in the hall over the Old Colony Railroad station, and
Wednesday morning received nineteen recruits from Plymouth.
In the afternoon of that day the Company embarked
on the steamer S. R. Spaulding, which hauled into the stream,
and anchored for the night. After the steamer had left the
wharf, seventeen additional recruits reached Boston, and
quartering in Faneuil Hall, joined their comrades aboard ship
on Thursday morning. On Thursday the 18th, the steamer
sailed for Fortress Monroe with sixty men in the ranks of the
company.</p>

<p>I do not propose at this stage of my memories to follow the
Plymouth soldiers to the front, but shall at a later point in my
narrative include a list of their names, and as far as possible
an account of their services in the field. While in Boston
with the Plymouth Company, I offered to the Governor on
Wednesday in behalf of the Plymouth bank, of which I was
President, the use of twenty thousand dollars as a contribution
to an emergency fund to meet expenditures which must
at once be made. I have every reason to believe that this
was the first contribution made by the banks of Massachusetts
to a fund, which when an extra session of the legislature convened
on the 14th of May, had reached the sum of thirty-six
hundred thousand dollars. This fund was necessary, as
when the extra session met the amount of the emergency fund
provided for at the regular session, had been exceeded by expenditures
and liabilities by the sum of four hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. On my return home the Selectmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
called an informal meeting of the citizens to meet on the afternoon
of Saturday the 20th to consider ways and means to
provide for the families of the soldiers. At that meeting it
was voted, “That the Selectmen be requested to apply and distribute
at their discretion a sum not exceeding $2,000 towards
the assistance of those families who by the sudden departure
of the troops are left in need of pecuniary aid—such
sum to be raised in the name of the town, or in such other way
as the Selectmen shall deem expedient.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 24th, I was in Philadelphia, and after
concluding the business which had called me there, I made up
my mind that if possible I would run on to Washington. General
Butler had left Philadelphia on Saturday the 20th, and at
Perryville on the north bank of the Susquehanna River, had
with the 8th Massachusetts Regiment embarked on board the
ferry boat Maryland for Annapolis, as the railroad between
the river and Baltimore had been obstructed, and the bridges
burned. The 7th New York Regiment, at the same time
took the steamer Boston at Philadelphia and started for Annapolis
by the way of the Delaware river and the sea. Going
to the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore station in
Broad street, I asked Mr. Felton, the President of the road,
if it were possible to reach Washington. He told me that
there was no communication by rail or wire with any point
south of the Susquehanna, and that nothing was known of
the movements of the Maryland since she left Perryville on
the previous Saturday. He said that Major T. W. Sherman’s
Battery was at Elkton on the line of the road awaiting
an opportunity to go to Washington, and that when the Maryland
returned from Annapolis he should despatch a train, with
the view of following in the wake of Gen. Butler. After
waiting in his office an hour or two, he told me that the boat
had arrived, and that he should start a train for Perryville at
four o’clock. At that hour the train started, made up of a
single passenger car, a combination car, and a platform car,
carrying two guns protected by a portholed sheet iron casemate.
There were only three or four on board, and not wishing
to be discommoded by impedimenta on a somewhat doubtful
excursion, I left my valise at the hotel. Arriving at Perryville
in the early evening with the Battery which we found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
waiting at Elkton, we embarked on the Maryland for the trip
down the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay outside of
Baltimore to Annapolis, which we reached about midnight.
On our way we passed over the anchorage ground where
Francis Scott Key, while a prisoner on board of a British man
of war in the war of 1812, witnessed the bombardment of
Fort McHenry, and wrote the “Star Spangled Banner.” As
we sailed over the spot the Battery men gathered on deck and
sang the song with the very scene in view which had originally
inspired it. Lying at the entrance of Annapolis harbor
until we had communicated by rockets with the town, we finally
reached the wharf, passing the frigate Constitution on the
way, which with sails bent by members of the Marblehead
companies in the eighth regiment was about to be taken for
safety to New York, manned with the Marblehead men. At
Annapolis we learned that when General Butler arrived with
the 8th Massachusetts, the rebels had torn up the track of the
branch road connecting Annapolis with the Baltimore and
Washington railroad, and disabled the locomotives. But the
General was equal to the emergency, and with mechanics in
his command he relaid the track, with machinists also in the
ranks he repaired the locomotives, and also with his Marblehead
soldiers he bent sails on the Constitution. The day before
he had marched on to the junction, and was then with
the 7th New York artillery at the junction, or in Washington.</p>

<p>We arrived in Washington about daylight on Thursday
morning, the 25th, and while registering my name at Willard’s
hotel, I heard the cry of fire, and going out found a
fire well started in a building on the avenue next to the hotel.
The efforts of the firemen seemed to be unavailing, with ladders
too short, and no means of reaching the roof of the building.
Directly cheers and the rattle of wheels were heard up
the avenue, and the Ellsworth Zouaves appeared on the scene.
They were quartered in the Capitol, and hearing the alarm had
jumped out of the windows, and breaking open an unused engine
house in which was stored an old engine, they dragged
the machine down the avenue at a double quick, and were at
once the chief actors in the scene. They were nearly all New
York firemen, and hence were called the Fire Zouaves, and
shinning up the water spouts they were soon on the roof,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
where I saw two of them hang a comrade by his legs over the
eaves so that he could reach the hose held by a ladderman,
and be pulled up with it to the flat roof above. What was
mere play for them was done in the presence of a cheering
crowd, and the fire was soon extinguished.</p>

<p>There were then four Regiments in Washington, the Sixth
Massachusetts, the Ellsworth Fire Zouaves, the Seventh Regiment
of New York and the First Rhode Island commanded
by Colonel Ambrose E. Burnside. The two first were in the
capitol, the Rhode Island Regiment was quartered in one of
the public buildings, and the Seventh Regiment was encamped.
All of these Regiments, except the 6th Massachusetts,
had reached Annapolis by the sea, and the 8th Massachusetts
Regiment was still encamped between Annapolis Junction and
Washington. I called on Col. Jones of the Sixth, and visited
the quarters of the other regiments. The tale told by
Col. Jones of his passage through Baltimore, and his reception
in Washington, was pathetic, indeed, and aroused a feeling
of pride in my state, which I had never so completely experienced
before. This feeling was intensified by the tales
told me by men of Washington who with tears in their eyes
described the march up the avenue of the regiment on the
nineteenth, and the sudden transformation from despair to
hope, from despondency to joy, from the fear of the capture
of the city to an assurance of its safety, the tale always ending
with the exclamation, “God Bless old Massachusetts.” Wherever
it was known, whence and how I came to Washington, I
found everything wide open. In the evening I returned to
Annapolis, and so on to Philadelphia, and reached home on
Saturday.</p>

<p>After my return the Selectmen issued a warrant for a town
meeting to be held on the 11th of May to further provide for
soldiers’ families, and to appropriate money for uniforms and
equipments. At that meeting it was voted to confirm the
vote passed at the informal meeting on the 20th of April, and
in addition it was voted to pay six dollars per month to each
soldier with a family, who shall enlist for the war, and four
dollars per month to each unmarried soldier during the term
of one year from the first of May. It was also voted to appropriate
$1,500 for equipping volunteers for three years’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
service, who might be citizens of Plymouth. At the special
session of the legislature convened on the 14th of May, the
state adopted the monthly pay to the soldiers, and it became
henceforth what was called state aid. Before the 6th of May
Samuel H. Doten had been authorized to recruit a company
for three years’ service, and had promptly enrolled sixty-seven
men, including himself, whose enlistment papers bore the
above date. By authority of the Selectmen, acting under the
vote of the town, passed on the 11th of May, the ladies of
the town at once bought materials, and in Leyden Hall, met
daily for the purpose of making uniforms. The company was
equipped at an expense of $1,025.49, and on the 18th of May
left for Boston. They marched directly to the State House,
where they were drawn up in Mt. Vernon street some hours
awaiting acceptance, and a supply of muskets and equipments,
including overcoats, blankets, knapsacks, and haversacks. The
acceptance of the company was delayed by the interference of
Hon. Henry Wilson, who had arrived that morning from
Washington, and was urging upon the Governor a stoppage
of enlistments. When I went to the Governor’s room to report
the arrival of the company, I met Mr. Wilson at the door,
and he said, “Davis, carry your company home, we have got
all the men we want, and more, too;” but notwithstanding
he was chairman of the committee on Military Affairs on the
part of the United States Senate, Governor Andrew disregarded
his opinion, and finally in due form accepted the company
and ordered the necessary arms and equipments. On
the 1st of January, 1861, the state owned ten thousand serviceable
muskets and twenty-five hundred Springfield rifles,
and after ineffectual efforts of myself and Capt. Doten, to secure
the rifles, the company was obliged to take up with the
inferior arms. On that afternoon, the 18th of May, the company
went on board the steamer Cambridge, and sailed for
Fortress Monroe, where it was attached to the Third Regiment
during that Regiment’s three months’ service.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Standish Guards, Plymouth was
left without a military company, and to meet any possible
emergency it was thought advisable to organize a Home
Guard. Its ranks were at once filled, and meetings were held
for drill in Davis Hall, which continued for several months.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
Nathaniel Brown, who in earlier days was skilled as a drill
master in the volunteer militia, was chosen captain, and I
held the position of 1st Lieutenant. As chairman of the
Board of Selectmen I urged the formation of the company,
believing that it would serve as a preparatory school for military
instruction; which would in due time develop a military
spirit, and promote enlistments. Such proved to be the effect
of the organization as of those who were at various times its
members, nearly all joined the army.</p>

<p>At the time of which I am speaking wage earners in Plymouth
found little to do, and the monthly pay to soldiers’ families
was proving inadequate to meet their necessities. The
wives and mothers of the soldiers were anxious to add to their
means of support if work could be furnished them. In order
to do what I could to help them I made arrangements with
a clothing house in Boston to send me such quantities of cut
out clothing as they were able, which was eagerly taken and
made up, and sent back to Boston. For some weeks my
house looked like a clothing store, with cases packing and
unpacking, and applicants for work coming and going with
bundles of garments either cut out or made up.</p>

<p>In the last week of May, Governor Andrew asked me to
visit the Massachusetts soldiers at their various camps, and report
to him in writing concerning their condition and needs,
and any complaints they might make of their treatment in the
service. These troops consisted of the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th
Massachusetts Regiments, already referred to, to which the
5th Regiment, Cook’s Battery and the Third Battalion of
Rifles had been added.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1861, the day of the inauguration of
President Lincoln, the government was without money and
without credit. Howell Cobb of Georgia, secretary of the
treasury, under Buchanan, had before resigning looted the
treasury, and placing about six millions where it could be
used by the projected Confederacy, had left the government
chest with not enough money to pay for a single day’s supply
of stationery. John B. Floyd of Virginia, secretary of war,
had before resigning, disarmed as far as possible the free
states, transferring from the arsenals at Springfield, Mass.,
and Watervliet, New York, to arsenals in the slave states, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
hundred and fifteen thousand arms, and a large amount of
cannon, mortars, balls, powder and shells. Isaac Toucey of
Connecticut, secretary of the navy, a northern man with southern
principles, had performed his part of the great conspiracy,
by so dispersing the national war vessels as to render
them ineffective in the hands of the government. Of a fleet
of ninety vessels, carrying 2,415 guns, five were sent to the
East Indies; three to Brazil; seven to the Pacific; three to the
Mediterranean, and seven to the coast of Africa, leaving, besides
dismantled ships, only two, the steamer Brooklyn, 25
guns, and the storeship Relief, two guns, in northern ports.
These men should not have been permitted to escape punishment,
not because they became secessionists, but because, while
holding office under a government which they had sworn to
support, they had been guilty of treason.</p>

<p>The well laid plan of the Confederates was to first weaken
the hands of the government while strengthening their own,
and then as soon as Sumter fell to seize Harper’s Ferry,
Washington and Fortress Monroe, the three outposts of the
slave states, and to hold them against any forces which the
north might be able to raise in time for their recovery. But
they calculated without their host. They failed to take into
account the rapidity with which Yankees act in an emergency,
and they believed that before the militia of the north could
be prepared to move, their own initiatory steps would have
been successfully taken. They little thought that within five
days after the fall of Sumter the state of Massachusetts would
occupy Fortress Monroe with two regiments, and Washington
with two more.</p>

<p>In the early movements of the government the depleted
state of the treasury made it necessary to seek the aid of the
states in carrying on the war. The first attempt to raise
money by a loan resulted in bids from bankers running from
85 to 40 for six per cent. bonds, all of which were rejected.
In this emergency Massachusetts as usual came to the front,
and buying two steamboats, the Cambridge and Pembroke,
kept them busy for many weeks in transporting from Boston
to Annapolis, Fortress Monroe and Washington soldiers, provisions
and camp equipage. As the rebel batteries on the
Potomac rendered for some time a passage to Washington by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
the river impracticable, at first the trips of these steamers were
chiefly confined to Fortress Monroe. As the Cambridge was
to sail on Friday, May 31, for the Fortress, Governor Andrew
asked me to go out in her and visit the Massachusetts
troops there, and if practicable in the neighborhood of Washington,
also, and as already stated, report to him their condition,
sanitary and otherwise, with the view of allaying the
anxieties of soldiers’ families from whom he had received
earnest inquiries. With Hon. John Morissey as a companion,
I left Boston at 4 o’clock, Friday afternoon, having also as
fellow passengers, General Ebenezer W. Pierce, with the members
of his staff, one of whom was Col. Wm. C. Lovering, our
present member of Congress. There were on board twenty
carpenters and twenty-nine sappers and miners, and our cargo
consisted of lumber, provisions and camp equipage of various
kinds. During the trip I spent much of my time in the
pilot house, and having kept a pretty close run of our courses
and distances, by a sort of instinct, I guessed from time to
time our position. About eight o’clock on Sunday evening,
while smoking my cigar in the pilot house, I said to Capt.
Matthews, “You, of course, know your own business better
than a landsman, but it seems to me that if you keep on this
course much longer you will go ashore.” His smile indicated
that he did not think much of a landsman’s reckoning, and
not long after I went below and turned in. I was soon awakened
by the stoppage of the engine, and directly a steward
rapped at my door and said that the steamer was ashore, and
the captain wanted all hands on deck. On reaching the deck
I found the propeller churning the water with a full back,
without any movement of the vessel. The two howitzers,
which had been on the forward deck, had been moved aft, and
all hands were jumping. It was fortunately a dead calm,
with scarcely a ripple on the shore, and after a while we succeeded
in backing into deep water. We had crossed a sand
bar just rubbing it, as we went, and had gone onto Hog Island
twenty-five or thirty miles north of Cape Charles. After
sending out a boat to sound a passage for recrossing the
bar, we reached about daylight the open sea, and were on our
way to the Fortress which we reached about ten o’clock Monday
forenoon. Some excuse may be found for the blunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
of the captain, in the fact that all the lights from Maryland
to Texas, except those at Key West, Tortugas and Rosas
Island, had been put out by the rebels, and possibly there may
have been a current setting to the north at that time. I believe,
however, that in navigation, as in many other matters,
there is something in instinct, or what you feel in your bones,
as old women say, which should not be disregarded.</p>

<p>When we landed at the Fortress, some of the Plymouth
boys were on the wharf expecting boxes from home, and they
were, of course, glad to see us. We loaded them down with
packages, of which a box of tea was the most prized, as tea
was not included in the regular rations. The Fortress is surrounded
by a moat, which is crossed by four bridges. Entering
the main gate after crossing the bridge leading to it, I
found myself in an area about seventy acres in extent, with
casemates on the right, barracks on the left, a parade ground
of about seven acres in the centre, and in the distance a two
story brick building, the headquarters of General B. F. Butler,
who was the commander at the post. Calling at once on
the General, with whom I was intimate, having been with him
in the senate two years before, he received us with courtesy,
and invited us to make his house our home as long as we remained
at the Fortress. He introduced us to his nephew,
Capt. John Butler, and Major Haggerty, members of his staff,
and to his military secretary, Major Theodore Winthrop, the
last of whom was our constant companion during our visit.
He and I seemed to have found our affinities, and I do not
think on so short an acquaintance I ever formed so strong an
attachment. When at the end of the week we left for Washington,
he came down to the steamboat to bid us good-bye, and
I little thought that on the next Monday, the 10th, he would
meet his death on the battlefield of Big Bethel. He was born
in New Haven, September 22, 1828, and in 1848 graduated
at Yale. He began the practice of law in St. Louis, but removed
to New York, where he acquired reputation as the author
of Cecil Dreeme, John Brent and other popular books.
He went to Washington with the New York seventh regiment,
and was selected by General Butler as a member of his
staff.</p>

<p>There were thirteen Massachusetts companies in the Fortress:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
The Halifax Company, Captain Harlow; Plymouth
Standish Guards, Capt. Charles C. Doten; Plymouth Rock
Guards, Capt. Samuel H. Doten; Freetown Company, Capt.
Marble; Plympton Company, Capt. Perkins; Carver Company,
Capt. McFarlin; New Bedford Company, Capt. Ingraham;
Cambridge Company, Capt. Richardson; Sandwich
Company, Capt. Chipman; East Bridgewater Company, Capt.
Leach; Lynn Company, Capt. Chamberlin; Boston Company,
Capt. Tyler; and Lowell Company, Capt. Davis.
Of these companies two, the Boston and Lynn, belonged
to the 4th Regiment, which was encamped at Newport
News, and the Lowell company was attached to the post, the
remaining ten forming the 3d regiment. The officers were
quartered in the casemates, and the privates in various buildings,
the Cambridge and Halifax companies in the carriage
shop, the Plympton company in a room overhead, the two
Plymouth companies in the forge, which had been floored
over, the East Bridgewater, New Bedford, Sandwich and
Lowell companies in other buildings, and the remainder of the
Massachusetts companies in tents. The health of the men
was good, only ten being in the hospital, and twenty off duty
all told in the thirteen companies. I made a note of the rations
for eleven days allowed to a company of seventy men,
which included 352½ pounds of pork; 352½ pounds of salt
beef; 45 quarts of beans; 47 quarts of rice, 103½ pounds of
coffee; 155 pounds of sugar; 10½ gallons of vinegar; 12¾
pounds of candles; 41 pounds of soap; 20½ quarts of salt;
352 pounds of fresh beef, a fresh supply of bread every day,
and an allowance of potatoes and chocolate. The East
Bridgewater Company had not received the new uniforms, the
Plympton Company was without overcoats, and none of the
companies had canteens or rubber blankets, all of which,
however, were supplied later. On the Hampton camping
ground outside of the Fortress, there were five New York
regiments, commanded by Colonels Duryea, Allen, Townsend,
Carr and McChesny, and General Pierce had his headquarters
in the Hampton female seminary. The troops I have mentioned,
with a few regulars made up the force at and about
the Fortress during my visit, which extended from the third
to the seventh of June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span></p>

<p>On Tuesday, June 4th, we went seven miles or more up
the bay to Newport News at the mouth of James River, where
the 4th Massachusetts Regiment was in camp. We went up
in the Steamer “Cataline,” a spelling of the name of the old
Roman, for which the author may have had the excuse of Major
Ben Russell, the editor of the <cite>Columbian Centinel</cite> who,
when printing his first number, having no capital S, substituted
C, and having begun with that letter, always continued
its use. At Newport News there were encamped all of the
Fourth Massachusetts Regiment except the two companies,
which were at the Fortress, the Steuben Rifles of New York
under Col. Bendix, and a Vermont regiment under Col.
Washburn, the whole under the command of Colonel
Phelps of Vermont. Newport News is a peninsula, bounded
on one side by the bay and on the other by James River, and
an earthwork had been constructed a half mile long, extending
across it. Three hundred and thirty of the Fourth were
without tents, and occupying huts made of rails covered with
branches. For several days tents had been lying piled up on
the wharf at the Fortress, but owing to inefficiency, or red
tape, they were not delivered until the sixth of June. The
hospital was in charge of F. A. Saville of Quincy, and from
the three regiments it had only three inmates. Henry
Walker, now a lawyer in Boston and the Commander of the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company on its late visit to
England, was Adjutant of the Fourth, and a friend whom I
was glad to see.</p>

<p>On Monday, the tenth of June, the next week after our visit,
General Pierce was ordered by General Butler to take five
companies of the Fourth, the Steuben Rifles, and Col. Washburn’s
New York Regiment, and go up the peninsula from
twelve to twenty miles and dislodge a force of rebels at Little
and Big Bethel. By a sad blunder Col. Washburn’s Regiment
was fired upon by the Steuben Rifles and eleven men
were killed, thus breaking up the expedition in which before
its retreat Major Winthrop and three of the Fourth Massachusetts
were killed.</p>

<p>The Sloop of War Roanoke under the command of Commodore
John Marston, the Steamer Vanderbilt, which had
been given to the government by Cornelius Vanderbilt, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
Revenue Cutter Harriet Lane temporarily attached to the
navy, were anchored between the Fortress and Newport
News. Commodore Marston was well known in Plymouth
by the Watson family, to whom he was related, and during a
winter spent in Philadelphia, where he lived, I was intimate
with him and his family. Both as an old friend and as a
Plymouth man, he extended to me every courtesy. The
Harriet Lane was commanded by Capt. John Faunce, a Plymouth
man, first cousin of our townsman, Richard W. Bagnell,
their mothers having been sisters, and daughters of Ebenezer
Sampson. John was one of the boys, as fearless as Paul
Jones or Farragut, and would have enjoyed nothing better
than to have a good ripping sea fight for our entertainment.
While we were at Newport News he ran across the mouth of
the James and banged away at a battery on Pig Point until
he was called off by the Commodore. He was glad enough
to see a Plymouth boy and while I was on his vessel I was
given the “freedom of the ship.”</p>

<p>General Ebenezer W. Pierce who went to the Fortress with
me in the Cambridge and who had command at Big Bethel,
had been detailed to command the three months’ men in Southern
Virginia. He was born in Freetown, Mass., April 5,
1822, and in the Massachusetts militia, before the war, had
occupied various positions from Captain to Brigadier General.
After he was mustered out July 22, 1861, at the expiration
of three months’ service, he again entered the army and
December 31, 1861, he was mustered in as Colonel of the
Massachusetts 29th Regiment, serving until his resignation
November 8, 1864. He was an eccentric man but patriotic
and brave. At the battle of White Oak Swamp June 30,
1862, I have been told that when he was ordered to take his
regiment into the fight his order was—“by the right flank
up the hill; God damn you, forward march.” Within five
minutes a ball from a rebel battery took off his right arm at the
shoulder. After the wound had been partially dressed under
fire he was left on the field within the rebel lines until night,
when he crept to cover and found his way to a union camp.
Within thirty days he reported for service again and continued
in commission until his resignation November 8, 1864. He
died in Freetown, August 14, 1902.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span></p>

<p>On Friday, the 7th of June, the despatch boat Mt. Vernon
arrived from Washington, and General Butler gave us passes
for her return trip that night. The boat, besides her captain,
had two river pilots, and as the lights on the Potomac had
been extinguished by the rebels we were guided through its
tortuous channels entirely by the lead. Besides the bearer
of despatches there was on board a guard of ten men of the
71st New York Regiment, and under deck there was a half a
ton of powder. All but one of the rebel batteries on the river
were passed in the night, and as we approached them we slowed
down so as to make little noise and put out all the lights on
board. One battery remained to be passed after daylight,
but as we rounded a point and brought it in sight we saw the
gunboat Powhattan anchored in the stream, having silenced
it since the down trip of the despatch boat. The bearer of
despatches was one of those fellows which war would be likely
to bring to the surface, apparently a German Jew, about twenty-five
years of age, bragging of his exploits as secret messenger
from Gen. Butler at Annapolis to Gen. Scott in Washington,
and distrusted by the guard, who called him the mysterious
cuss. Every step he took and every movement he
made was carefully watched, lest he might by a match or some
other signal inform the batteries of our passage. I learned on
a later visit to Washington that he came to grief as a suspected
rebel spy.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Navy Yard at Washington about ten o’clock,
after breakfast at the hotel we visited the 5th Massachusetts
Regiment, of which my friend, George H. Brastow
was Major. They were encamped near Alexandria, and with
the 5th Pennsylvania, 1st Michigan and the Ellsworth Zouaves
formed the Union outpost near Shooter’s Hill, between
Alexandria and the Fairfax seminary. The next day, Sunday,
I went out to the Relay House at the junction of the
Harper’s Ferry and the Baltimore and Washington Railroads,
where were encamped the 6th and 8th Massachusetts Regiments
and Cook’s Massachusetts Battery. I spent the night
with Col. Hincks of the 8th, whose commissary of the post
was Dexter F. Parker of Worcester. The Colonel was a
clerk in the office of the Secretary of State when I was in
the Senate in 1858 and 1859, and Commissary Parker was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
brother Senator in 1859. Their camp was delightfully situated
on the grounds of Dr. Hall overlooking the Valley of
the Patapsco River. On Monday I went down to Baltimore
and rode round to Fort McHenry, where the 3d Massachusetts
Battalion of Rifles, under Major Charles Devens was quartered.
This Battalion consisted of the Worcester City Guards
and the Holden Rifles, to which were attached the Emmet
Guards of Worcester and a Boston Company, raised after
the call for troops was issued. I found General Banks at the
Fort, and on our way back to Baltimore together he criticised
the limitation of the President’s call to 75,000 men, feeling
assured that the war was to be a long one. He was wise in
his anticipation of a long war, but I think he was mistaken
as to the call. The delay in raising a larger number of three
months’ men would have disheartened the North and encouraged
the South, and a larger call for short service would have
interfered with enlistments for a long one. On the whole it
seems to me that the early war measures were conceived and
executed by wise, far-seeing men. From Baltimore I returned
home and made a report to the Governor.</p>

</div>


<p>I have spoken in the last chapter of being intimate with Commodore
John Marston and family during a winter I spent in
Philadelphia. There was another Commodore whom I knew
there. I lived four months next door to Commodore James
Barron, who in 1820 killed Commodore Stephen Decatur in a
duel. Before the war of 1812 Barron was in command of
the Ship Chesapeake, from which, under a claimed right of
search, a British frigate had taken several sailors, alleged to
be British. For his conduct in that affair he was tried and
sentenced to five years’ suspension without pay. After the
war he returned from Europe where he had lived some time,
and his application for employment in the navy was opposed
by Decatur on the ground that he had been disloyal to his
country in not returning to fight her battles. A challenge followed,
and a duel was fought on the historic field of Bladensburg.
Both fired together, Decatur receiving a mortal wound
in the breast, and Barron a wound in the thigh which he
thought was also mortal. As they lay on the ground bleeding,
the scene was a pathetic one. Barron said, “I hope, Decatur,
when we meet in heaven that we shall be better friends than
we have been here.” Decatur answered, “I have not been
your enemy, but tell me, Barron, why you did not come home
and fight for your country.” Barron replied, “I had been living
many years in Europe, and had contracted debts which
I could not run away and leave unpaid.” “Ah,” said Decatur,
“If I had known that, we should not be lying here awaiting
death.” Barron recovered, and was again employed in the service.
His life was saddened by the event, but he never alluded
to the melancholy scenes attending it. “If I had known that,”
said Decatur! Alas, how many duels might have been averted
if the parties had come together and heard in a personal interview
reasons and explanations. Yes, and in the broader field
of national honor if nations had sent their representatives to
discuss dispassionately their complaints and differences, how
many thousands of lives might have been saved and how many
millions of treasure.</p>

<p>After returning from a visit to the Massachusetts troops at
the front I was kept busy during the summer of 1861, enlisting
men in Plymouth, and Kingston and other neighboring towns.
I was several times in Washington on business in the war and
navy departments. Simon Cameron was secretary of war
from the 4th of March, 1861, until January, 1862, when he
was succeeded by Edwin M. Stanton. I have nothing of interest
to say concerning the former, but later I shall tell a story
of my interview with the latter in October, 1862. The secretary
of the Navy was Gideon Welles of Connecticut, but
Gustavus Vasa Fox, the assistant secretary, was really the
right hand of the department. Mr. Fox I had known for
many years, my acquaintance beginning when a midshipman
he came, I think in 1838, to Plymouth in the practice brig Apprentice,
commanded by Lieut. Moore, and anchoring in beach
channel, remained over a Sunday and attended church. He
was a remarkable man, thought by some to be the strongest
man connected with the administration during the war. He
was born in Saugus, Massachusetts, June 13, 1821, and was
appointed midshipman January 12, 1838. In 1856 he resigned
with the rank of first lieutenant, and was appointed agent of
the Bay State Mills in Lawrence. In March, 1861, he was
sent by President Lincoln to Charleston to confer with Major
Anderson about sending him aid at Fort Sumter, and was
soon appointed assistant secretary of the Navy. To him was
due the plan for the capture of New Orleans, and the selection
of Farragut for the command in which he distinguished himself.
His sound judgment and earnest advice led to the construction
of the Monitor, and he established and perfected the
blockade. After the war he was assigned to the duty of carrying
the ram Miantonomah to the Baltic, which had been
sold to the Russian government, and he was at the same time
made a bearer of despatches conveying the congratulations of
our government to Emperor Alexander 2nd, on his escape
from assassination on the 16th of April, 1866. The Miantonomah
was the first iron-clad to cross the ocean, and Capt. Fox
reported her a comfortable craft, which instead of pitching
and rolling in heavy weather, took the seas across her deck,
and remained comparatively on an even keel. On his return
home he was appointed manager of the Middlesex Mills in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
Lowell, and died in New York, October 29, 1883. In my
communications with him, concerning appointments in the
service, I never failed to receive a favorable response. I was
the more careful therefore in making requests. In one instance
I recommended a man for ensign, and hearing something
soon after leading me to doubt his competency. I immediately
wrote to Mr. Fox withdrawing my recommendation,
and the applicant now dead, failed to receive an appointment.
Sometimes at a later period of the war I was often asked to intercede
in behalf of some soldier for a furlough. I remember
the case of an officer, now dead, who was quite successful in
obtaining furloughs on his own account, and who was in the
habit while at home of criticising the conduct of the war. On
one of his visits an old lady said, “lah, that —— is home again—this
is the curiousest war that ever I see, if they don’t like the
percedings they come home.” In quoting the quaint remark
of the old lady I do not intend to suggest any doubt of the
fidelity of a brave and efficient officer who probably had good
and sufficient reasons for his furloughs.</p>

<p>The Standish Guards returned home after their three
months’ service, on the 23d of July, and were received at the
railroad station by the Home Guard, and in the evening at a
festival in Davis hall. The officers of the company chosen
after their arrival at Fortress Monroe, were Charles C. Doten,
captain, and Otis Rogers and Wm. B. Alexander first and 2nd
lieutenants, respectively. Lemuel Bradford, 2nd, who went
out with the company as 4th lieutenant, was not permitted to
be mustered, as only two lieutenants were allowed to each
company. I have always understood that four lieutenants
were mustered in the companies of the 5th, 6th, and 8th Massachusetts
Regiments in and about Washington, where for
some unknown reason a different rule prevailed.</p>

<p>In August, 1861, a second three years’ company was recruited
by Capt. Joseph W. Collingwood to be attached as Co.
H. to the 18th Massachusetts Regiment. All the men of this
company were enlisted in the recruiting office established by
the Plymouth Selectmen. Thirteen Plymouth men were enlisted
in Co. H, and eight in other companies of the 18th Regiment.
The Regiment was mustered into service August 24,
and on the 26th left Readville, where they had been in camp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
for Washington, joining the army of the Potomac at Hall’s
Hill near that city.</p>

<p>In September, 1861, Capt. Wm. B. Alexander was authorized
to raise a company to be attached as Co. E to the 23d
Regiment, and ninety-seven men were enlisted at the Plymouth
office, of whom sixty were Plymouth men. This company,
with Wm. B. Alexander, Capt., and Otis Rogers, and
Thomas B. Atwood, respectively, first and second lieutenants,
went into camp at Lynfield, and November 11 left for Annapolis.
Three other Plymouth men later joined Co. E as recruits,
and three Plymouth men joined other companies in the
23d regiment.</p>

<p>In December, 1861, Lieutenant Josiah C. Fuller aided in recruiting
Company E for the first Battalion of Massachusetts,
which was finally recognized as the 32d Regiment, and twenty
men were enlisted in Plymouth. Twenty more were enlisted
for Company F, and four more for other companies in the
same regiment, and three recruits were added later to Company
E. This regiment was organized for garrison duty at
Fort Warren in Boston harbor with Josiah C. Fuller, Capt. of
Company E, and Edward F. Phinney second lieutenant of
Company F, and May 20, 1862, left for Washington.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, 1862, an order was issued at headquarters,
stating that Massachusetts had been called on for fifteen
thousand men, of which number Plymouth was required to
furnish sixty. The Governor asked me to raise two companies
to be designated as Companies D and G in the 38th
Regiment, and to select officers for them. I first enlisted men
for Company D, and soon filled its ranks with thirty men from
Plymouth, and the remainder from neighboring towns. I first
recommended Chas. H. Drew for captain, Cephas Washburn
and Albert Mason, first and second lieutenants, respectively.
Charles H. Drew was then first lieutenant in Company H,
18th Regiment, and the war department refused to muster
him out to enable him to receive his commission. I then filled,
the ranks of Company G with thirty-one from Plymouth, and
the remainder from neighboring towns, and recommended
Charles C. Doten for captain and George B. Russell, second
lieutenant. The town’s quota was completed by one enlistment
for the 13th Regiment, one for the 20th and one for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
35th. The 38th Regiment went into camp at Lynfield, and
September 24, 1862, left for Baltimore, where it went into
camp near the city and left November 9th in the steamer
Baltic for Ship island. I went with the Plymouth companies
to Lynfield and spent a week with them under canvas to aid
in making requisitions for equipments, and looking generally
after the comfort of the men. My classmate, Wm. Logan
Rodman of New Bedford, was commissioned Major of the
Regiment, and later before it left, lieutenant colonel. When
the commission as lieutenant colonel was offered to
him he asked my advice about accepting it, as he knew nothing
about military matters, but he was finally commissioned,
and in the absence of Col. Ingraham, went to Baltimore in
command of the regiment. Poor fellow, he was killed at the
siege of Port Hudson in May, 1863. He was lying down with
his command behind logs, and lifting his head was instantly
killed by a rebel sharpshooter. During my stay at the Lynfield
Camp, I for the first time was christened with a high
military title. Patrick Maguire of Company D was found
one night outside the camp somewhat under the influence of
liquor, and carried to the guard house. When asked what
regiment he belonged to he said, “by gorrah, I don’t belong to
no regiment at all, I belong to Davis’s brigade.”</p>

<p>In August, 1862, a call was made for 300,000 nine months’
men, of which the quota of Plymouth was thirty-seven.
Every organized militia company in the 3d Regiment was
authorized to recruit up to the standard, but as it would be
impossible to fill the Standish Guards and the Carver and
Plympton companies, it was agreed that the three companies
should recruit together as Company B, the letter of the Standish
Guards, under a Carver Captain, and with a first lieutenant
from the Guards, and a second lieutenant from the Plympton
company. Under this arrangement Thos. B. Griffith was
made captain; Charles A. S. Perkins of Plymouth, first lieutenant,
and Wm. S. Briggs of Middleboro, second lieutenant.
Thirty men enlisted in Plymouth, including John Morissey,
who was appointed Major. The regiment went into camp
at Lakeville, and October 22, 1862, sailed from Boston in the
steamships Merrimac and Mississippi for Newbern, North
Carolina. Twelve other nine months’ men were enlisted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
Plymouth for the 4th, 6th, 44th, 45th and 50th Regiments.
Thirty-five of the nine months’ men received a bounty of one
hundred dollars in accordance with a vote of the town.</p>

<p>After the defeat of General Pope by General Lee at the
second Bull Run, the rebel army crossed the Potomac at Noland’s
ford, and reached Frederick in Maryland on the 6th
of September, 1862. In the meantime General McClellan had
been restored to the command of the army of the Potomac,
and crossing the Potomac in pursuit of Lee, entered Frederick
on the 12th, two days after its evacuation by the rebel
army. On the 13th the union army passed through Frederick
and overtook the rebel army at South mountain, where they
fought a victorious battle on the 14th. The pursuit was kept
up through Boonesboro and Keedysville, until Antietam river
was reached, where the rebel army was strongly entrenched.
Without intending to write a history of the battle, I think I
can say as a result of my frequent studies of the conflict, that
the Massachusetts troops acquitted themselves with special
bravery. The battle was won, but while Burnside on the left
was fighting desperately to hold a position, the loss of which
would have involved the defeat of the army, and was calling
on McClellan for aid, the 18th corps, under Fitz John Porter,
to which the 18th and 32d Massachusetts belonged, was held
fifteen thousand strong in reserve, and had no share in the
battle. With the light we now have it is easy to see that if the
reserves had been put in at the critical moment, as they were
put in by Wellington at Waterloo, when he shut his field glass
with a snap and gave the order, “Up guards, and at them,”
the rebel army would have been destroyed before it recrossed
the Potomac. The only excuse for McClellan was his belief
that the battle was only suspended, not terminated, when
night set in, and that on the morrow the army with fresh
troops would win.</p>

<p>In the two battles, of South Mountain on the 14th of September,
and Antietam on the 17th, the Massachusetts regiments
suffered severely. In the first the 12th, 13th, 21st and
28th regiments, and the 1st and 8th batteries were engaged,
and in the last the 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 28th,
29th and 35th regiments, and two batteries. The 12th had
seventy-four killed and 165 wounded, the 15th had 108 killed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
and the 29th, 9 killed and 31 wounded, while the others suffered
in various degrees between the highest and lowest as
above. The most severely wounded were carried to hospitals
on the field, and to temporary hospitals in Sharpsburgh and
Frederick, while those less severely wounded were carried to
Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia, and some sent to
their homes. Governor Andrew asked me to go out and visit
the Massachusetts men, wherever they might be found in the
hospitals. They needed no supplies, for they were abundantly
furnished by the commissariat and the sanitary commission
with everything from bedding and underclothing to wines and
canned fruits and preserves. But there was something which
neither of these agencies could supply, something to remove
the depression of spirits which a sick man feels away from
home, and which is the greatest obstacle to recovery. I have
often seen the pallid cheeks of a soldier furrowed with pain,
light up with a smile as he opened his eyes and found standing
by his bedside a messenger from home.</p>

<p>Reaching Baltimore at night, I met at the hotel Dr. LeBarron
Russell, and the next morning we went together by rail to
Frederick, where we passed the night. Every available public
building, including churches, had been converted into a
hospital, and in one of these I remember finding Barnabas
Dunham of Plymouth, a member of the 29th Regiment. In
one of the church hospitals, I found Dr. Theodore Cornish in
charge, brother of the late Aaron H. Cornish of Plymouth,
who I think was either surgeon or assistant surgeon in a
Rhode Island regiment. He gave us much information about
the condition of the wounded in Frederick, and their dispersion
to other places. About five years ago I met him on the
steamboat coming to Plymouth, never having seen him since
our interview in Frederick, and called him by name. He
failed to recognize me until I reminded him of my encountering
him in the hospital dressing the wound of a soldier who
had been operated on by an excision of a section of the humerus
to avoid amputation. The next morning we hired a conveyance
to Boonesboro, a small village, through whose streets
both armies had passed from South Mountain gap, where
the battle of September 14th had been fought. The shattered
trees and levelled fences and trodden down fields told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
their story of the conflict. We passed the night at Boonesboro,
finding no Massachusetts wounded there. I was amused
at a custom prevailing in that neighborhood disclosed to me
by the landlady, when to a mild complaint of sleeping on a
blanket, she answered that nobody thought of putting more
than one sheet on the bed. The next morning we rode on
to Keedysville, a straggling village of five hundred inhabitants,
where nearly all the houses contained wounded men.
There was a provost marshal stationed there, and going to
his office we were surprised to find him to be Capt. Joseph W.
Collingwood. His company was attached to Fitz John Porter’s
Corps, held in reserve, and consequently had not been in
the battle. Taking Capt. Collingwood into our carriage we
drove to the Locust Spring hospital, containing under canvas
about two hundred and fifty severely wounded men. Here
Charles Henry Robbins, son of Hernan C. Robbins of Plymouth,
died from a wound received in the battle. I saw his
nurse, a fine woman from Chicago, named Mary Everingham,
who expressed great interest in him, and I visited his grave
in a pleasant field marked with a head and foot stone by a
soldier named Keith of North Bridgewater, from which I took
a stone to carry to his mother. Mr. Robbins belonged to
Company H, 35th regiment, and enlisted in Weymouth. The
next field tent hospital which we visited was at Smoketown,
less than a mile from the extreme right of the Union line of
battle, where hard fighting was done under Hooker in the
early part of the day. This hospital contained about four
hundred and fifty patients, under the charge of Dr. Vanderkeefe,
a Hollander, who had served in the Crimea. His hospital
was a model in care, cleanliness, distribution of comforts,
and surgical skill. The work done by the sanitary commission
was wonderful. At the first sign of a battle it despatched
many wagons loads of sheets, coverlids, beds, towels,
handkerchiefs, preserved meats, stockings, drawers,
shirts, bandages, wines, etc., which reached the vicinity
of the battle field before a gun was fired, and was ready
for work when the wounded were carried to the rear. From
this point we rode over the whole battle field, four miles in
length, from Hooker’s cornfield to Burnside’s bridge, by the
sunken road and the Dunker church, still littered with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
debris of battle, and reached Sharpsburg late in the afternoon,
on our way visiting Porter’s camp, and calling on Captains
Charles H. Drew and Wm. H. Winsor of the 18th Massachusetts
regiment. Late in the evening we reached Harper’s
Ferry, where after a supper of ham and eggs we found sleeping
quarters in an attic room, lighted and ventilated by a
broken glass scuttle, and equipped with a bed with broken
slats, leaving us to sleep on the floor, with our heads and feet
on the rails of the bedstead. The next morning we went out
to Boliver Heights, and visited the camps of the 15th, 19th,
20th and 29th Massachusetts regiments, the last having returned
the night before from an expedition to Charlestown,
and in the evening went by rail to Washington.</p>

<p>During my stay in Washington I visited all the hospitals,
beginning with Lincoln Hospital. While passing through one
of the wards I heard my name called by an occupant of one
of the beds. Responding to the call I found a young man
whom I had enlisted in Plymouth a few months before as a
recruit for Col. Lee’s 20th Regiment. His name was Erik
Wolff, a Swede of good education, who came to America to
learn to become a soldier, and thought that promotion would
be sure and speedy. His father, a merchant in Gottenburg,
had had some years before business relations with Capt. John
Russell, and having letters of introduction to Capt. Russell’s
family he came at once to Plymouth on his arrival. He was
now very sick with typhoid fever, and in his anxiety to be
discharged, was so depressed in spirits that the surgeon said
his recovery was hopeless, unless his discharge was secured.
Col. Lee’s efforts had been unavailing, as at that time every
application of the kind was rejected by the department. I
told him that I would see what I could do, and jumping into
a horse car, rode at once to the war department, reaching
there before the office of the secretary was open. A long line
of men and women stretched down the hall, all with anxious
faces, evidently waiting to ask some favor of the secretary.
When the door was opened the line shortened up so rapidly
that I felt sure that short work was made of the applications.
When I reached the door Mr. Stanton was standing at a small
standing desk, and turning off the applicants right and left.
I had never seen him before, and had no reason to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
that he had ever seen or heard of me. When my turn came
I told him my story in as few words as possible, that I enlisted
Wolff, that he was a foreigner, on whose service we had no
claim, and was in the Lincoln hospital. Not a word was
spoken by the secretary, not a single question asked, but as
soon as I finished he touched a hand bell, to which an officer
responded, and the secretary said, “Mr. Davis, if you will
follow Major Hardee, he will make out the discharge.”
Within two hours from the time I left the hospital I returned
with the discharge to gladden the young fellow’s heart. He
recovered after a protracted confinement, and returned to
Massachusetts, receiving later from Governor Andrew a captain’s
commission in the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment.
On my way home I visited the hospitals in Baltimore and
West Philadelphia, carrying with me a realizing sense of the
terrible incidents of war. I have told the story of my interview
with Secretary Stanton to show the injustice of the
charge that he was destitute of sympathy for the soldiers
whom he used merely as a part of the machinery of war.</p>

<p>Proceeding in my narrative in chronological order, in the
winter of 1862 and 1863, strenuous, but unavailing efforts
were made by Governor Andrew to have the exposed harbors
of the state properly protected. Finally it was determined
to construct earthworks on the Gurnet and Saquish, and the
work was entered upon at once under the direction of the
Selectmen at the expense of the Commonwealth. I obtained
from Mr. Fox, assistant secretary of the Navy, an order on
Commodore Hudson in command at the Charlestown Navy
Yard for seven guns for Fort Andrew, and five for Fort
Standish, and had carriages made in Plymouth. These forts
were completed in the early summer of 1863, and Governor
Andrew was advised by the selectmen of their intention to
name that on the Gurnet, Fort Andrew, and that on the Saquish,
Fort Sandish. On the 16th of March I received from
the Governor the following letter:</p>

<p>Dear Sir.—No fort as yet bears the name which your board
of selectmen has so generously proposed for the larger fort
now in progress in Plymouth harbor, nor had any ambition
of my own ever suggested to my mind the possibility of becoming
in that manner associated with such a work. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
deeply sensible of the honor; and while I feel that it does not
properly belong to me, I can only leave to you and your associates
the final decision, with a single suggestion that it would
seem to be more fitting the occasion to connect the name of
the first Governor of the Plymouth Colony with one of the
fortifications of the harbor of Plymouth than the name you
propose, even if I were a hundred times more worthy than
I know myself to be.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Governor Andrew’s modest estimate of
his public services, the fort received his name.</p>

<p>In 1862 I became quite intimate with Capt. James Birdseye
McPherson of the United States Engineers. He was undoubtedly
one of the ablest officers in the army, and his early
death closed a career of great brilliancy. It was widely believed
in the army up to the time of his death, that if Grant
had died or resigned, he would have been his successor. During
several years of the war I was obliged to spend much time
in Boston, and while there I made the Tremont House my
home. There were five or six regular bachelor boarders
who occupied a table by themselves, one of whom was Capt.
McPherson. He was born in Sandusky, Ohio, November 14,
1828, and graduated at West Point first scholar in the class
of 1853. He rose rapidly, and while serving as an engineer
in California, he became acquainted with General Halleck.
When the war came on, having been promoted to a captaincy
he was sent to Boston to mount guns on Fort Warren, and it
was at that time that he boarded at the Tremont House, and
at the table where he sat I was always when in town offered
a chair. No one could meet and talk with him without being
struck with his clear eye, his thoughtful face and thoroughly
trustworthy deportment. One afternoon while I was at the
Hotel, Captain Paraclete Holmes of Kingston, boarding there
took up the <cite>Transcript</cite> and read aloud a news paragraph stating
that Capt. McPherson had been ordered west to join the
staff of General Halleck. When the Captain came in he was
shown the despatch, and said that he knew nothing about it.
When, however, he received his evening mail, his orders
reached him. As he was ordered to report at once, we arranged
a parting supper for the next evening, for which I remember,
by the way, I ordered a gallon of oysters, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
been bedded on the Plymouth flats by S. D. Ballard, and
which were pronounced by the supper party as the best they
had ever tasted. When I bade the Captain good bye he said,
“I shall have an opportunity now to see whether I have mistaken
my profession.” The sequel demonstrated that he had
not. He was soon promoted to be Major General of volunteers,
and transferred to the staff of General Grant as Chief
Engineer, serving with him at the battles of Fort Henry,
Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Corinth and Iuka. He later commanded
the right wing of Grant’s army, and at the siege of
Vicksburg commanded the 17th Army Corps. After Grant
assumed command of the army of the Potomac, he joined
Sherman, under whom he was in command of 30,000 men.
At the siege of Atlanta he was killed, July 22, 1864, at the age
of thirty-five.</p>

<p>I was again in Washington visiting the hospitals after the
battle of Fredericksburg, on the 13th of December, 1862, and
after the death of Capt. Collingwood on the 24th, I sent a
despatch to Andrew L. Russell, who informed his family and
friends. I was on a visit to the College hospital in Georgetown,
when Capt. Charles H. Drew was brought in severely
wounded in the Fredericksburg battle. It fell to me while in
Washington, during the battles of the Wilderness, to send a
despatch to Mr. Russell, informing him of the death of Lemuel
B. Morton, killed at the battle of Spotsylvania Court
House, May 12, 1864.</p>

<p>On the 17th of July, 1863, as the result of a draft, one Plymouth
man commuted, thirteen found substitutes, and three entered
the service. In the autumn of 1863, under a call for
500,000 men, the quota of Plymouth was fixed at one hundred
and seventeen. After the selectmen reported that the quota
had been filled they were notified that in consequence of a
delay in crediting enlistments for the army and navy, there
existed a deficiency of twenty-five men, which must be filled
by a draft. One man was held under the draft who found a
substitute, and before another draft was ordered the selectmen
had filled the quota by the purchase of recruits in Boston.
A vote had been passed by the town offering to recruits a
bounty of $125, and a committee of citizens were appointed to
raise such funds to increase the bounty to such an amount as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
the selectmen might think advisable. The committee raised
the sum of $3,776.25, and with this sum and the bounty, voted
by the town, the selectmen secured twenty-two recruits for
the army and four for the navy. Another call for 500,000 men
was made July, 1864, and with money raised by the above committee
to wit, $5,011.00, the selectmen obtained twenty-six recruits,
who with the credit for the men in the navy heretofore
withheld, and one representative recruit purchased by a citizen,
filled the quota of the town.</p>

<p>On the 19th of November, 1864, seven Plymouth men were
mustered into the 20th unattached company, stationed at
Marblehead for one year’s service, and on the 11th of December,
forty-two more were mustered into the 26th unattached
company raised to garrison Forts Andrew and Standish, but
which finally was stationed at Readville, where it remained
until it was mustered out. Until a late period in the war, the
recruiting office in Plymouth was kept up by the selectmen,
and at various times ninety-eight were enlisted in Plymouth
and other places for the 1st, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 16th, 17th,
18th, 20th, 24th, 28th, 30th, 34th, 41st, 55th, 58th, Massachusetts
Regiments, 1st, 4th, 5th Massachusetts Cavalry, 2nd
Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 12th Massachusetts
Batteries, 2nd Massachusetts Sharpshooters, 3rd Rhode Island
Cavalry, 5th, 8th New Hampshire Regiments, 3rd, 10th, 99th,
New York Regiments, 10th Pennsylvania Regiment, 8th Illinois
Regiment, the Signal Corps, President’s Guard, Veteran
Reserve Corps and California Cavalry. In addition to the
above, six were recruited by the commission appointed to recruit
in rebel states, and credited to Plymouth, and the following
re-enlistments were also credited to the town—six in Co. E,
29th Massachusetts Regiment, one each in companies C, E
and H, 18th Regiment, twelve in Co. E, 23rd Regiment, eight
in Co. E, 32nd Regiment, five in Co. F, 32nd Regiment, four
in other companies in the 32nd Regiment, two in the 1st Cavalry,
one in the 58th Regiment, one in the Rhode Island Cavalry,
one in the 17th Regiment, one in the 30th Regiment, one
in the Regular Army, and one in the Corps D’Afrique. On
the first day of February, 1866, all the above soldiers enlisted
and re-enlisted to the credit of the town had been mustered
out except Brevet Major Geo. B. Russell, Provost Marshal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
of the District of Columbia, and Philander Freeman and
Stephen M. Maybury in the regular army. Before closing this
record of the Plymouth soldiers in the war it should be stated
that on the 26th day of May, 1862, a telegram was received by
Governor Andrew from the war department urging him to send
at once all the militia force of the state, as General Banks had
been driven from the Shenandoah Valley, and Washington was
in danger. On the 27th in obedience to an order from the Governor,
Capt. Charles C. Doten reported in Boston with the
Standish Guards of fifty-seven men. Fear for the safety of
the Capital, however, was soon dissipated, and the company
returned home without being mustered into the service.</p>

<p>In order to complete the roll of men furnished by Plymouth
for the war, it only remains to say that the enlistments in the
navy were three acting lieutenants, six ensigns, ten masters,
two acting masters, seventeen mates, one assistant paymaster,
three assistant engineers, one sailmaker, and sixty-five seamen.</p>

<p>One of the most troublesome features of the service which
the selectmen were called on to perform, was that regulating to
filling the towns quotas with purchased men. There were
private recruiting offices in Boston, where men were furnished,
and to a great extent the recruits offering themselves were
bounty jumpers as we called them. Unless a sharp eye was
kept on these recruits, and the bounty withheld until they were
examined by an army surgeon in Faneuil hall, and receipts
given for them by the Provost Marshal, stating age, date of
enlistment and Regiments for which they were enlisted, they
would take up with a higher bid, or steal away with the
bounty and receive another elsewhere. I landed all my men,
but I knew of a number of cases where unwary selectmen lost
their bounty and their men. Many recruits who failed in their
efforts to evade service after they had received their bounty,
deserted their regiments and enlisted where they could safely
do so with another bounty.</p>

<p>The whole number of men furnished by Plymouth for the
war was 653 soldiers and 111 naval officers and seamen, which
number filled all the quotas and left a surplus of 28 to the
credit of the town. The cost to the town for all purposes connected
with the war was a little more than $28,000, to which
should be added $8,787.25 subscribed by the citizens for
bounties.</p>

<p>In speaking of the changes, in habits and customs, which
have occurred in my day, it will be difficult to draw the line
between those, which only my older readers will remember,
and those more recent ones, which will be recalled by the
young. In noting these changes I shall not confine myself
to Plymouth, but shall as far as possible include those which
have elsewhere come under my observation. The population
of Plymouth in 1820, two years before my birth, was 4,384.
Its growth to 11,017, in 1905, is one of the least remarkable
changes in the history of the town during that period. Turning,
however, to the nationality of the population, we find a
change which has kept pace with the growing facilities of
international communication, and the restless tide of migration,
which characterized the 19th century. This change in
nationality began to show itself about the time of my birth.
Up to that time the population was not only practically wholly
American, but also largely of Plymouth nativity. There are
records showing that in 1813 there were two Irishmen, John
Burke and Michael Murphy, living in Plymouth, and there
are reasons for believing that they and their families were the
only persons of Irish birth in the town. It is possible that the
above two men were servants, or employees of Judge Joshua
Thomas, who lived in the house on Main street, now called
the Plymouth Tavern. At any rate, Judge Thomas must
have felt a special interest in them, as in the year above mentioned,
1813, Bishop Cheverus, by his invitation, came down
from Boston and celebrated mass for their benefit in the parlors
on the southerly side of his house. It is undoubtedly true that
Bishop Cheverus was the most distinguished Divine who ever
visited Plymouth. He was born in Mayenne, France, Jan. 28,
1768, and came to Boston in 1796, where he became associated
with the Catholic mission. In 1803 he raised by subscription
money to build the Catholic church in Franklin street, the site
of which is now occupied by Devonshire street, and more than
$3,000 of the sum raised was subscribed by Protestants, of
whom John Adams headed the list. The esteem in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
was held in Boston was further shown by the gratuitous services
of Charles Bulfinch, the distinguished architect, who furnished
the design for the church, and by the gift of a picture
of the crucifixion by Henry Sargent, a Boston artist, to place
on its walls. Among the subscribers to the church fund were
Harrison Gray Otis, Benjamin Crowinshield, Theodore Lyman,
Thomas H. Perkins and Samuel Dexter, and General
E. Hasket Derby gave the church a bell. While in Boston
Bishop Cheverus accepted invitations to preach in Protestant
churches, following as he said, the example of Christ, who
preached in the synagogues. In 1810 he was consecrated in
Baltimore the first Bishop of Boston, and in 1818 his associate,
the Abbé Mantignon, died, at whose funeral the body was
borne to the grave through the streets of Boston with the
Bishop wearing ecclesiastical garments, and a mitre, presenting
a novel scene to the eyes of New England people. In 1823, the
Bishop was called to France to take charge of the Bishopric of
Montauban, and in 1826 was nominated to the Metropolitan
See of Bordeaux. In 1828 he was made councillor of state,
and in 1830 commander of the order of the Holy Ghost. In
February, 1836, he was made a Cardinal, and on the 9th of
March received from Louis Philippe the Cardinal’s hat. He
died July 2d, 1836.</p>

<p>Until ocean steamers were built of sufficient size to accommodate
steerage passengers, immigration was chiefly confined to
the Irish, who came in the packet ships plying between London
or Liverpool and New York, Philadelphia, or Boston. There
were the Cambridge, Devonshire, London, Henry Clay, Yorkshire,
Liverpool, Ashburton and Hottingeur, coming to New
York; the Daniel Webster, North America, Anglo Saxon and
Ocean Monarch coming to Boston, and the Tuscarora and
Shenandoah to Philadelphia, and for some years their steerages
were crowded with Irish immigrants. With the coming in of
the steamers the numbers largely increased. It was during the
period from 1835 to 1855, that the Irish element began to be
perceptible to any considerable extent in Plymouth. Within my
day the first Irishman to come to the town was John Cassidy,
about 1820 or 1830. He had been living for a time in
Boston, and there his son, John S., our townsman, was born.
He was a blacksmith by trade, and a man of striking appearance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
He had two daughters, whom I knew very well, fine
women; Elizabeth, who married Gridley T. Poole, and Ellen,
who married a Mr. Southmayd of Campton, New Hampshire.
There was a Michael McCarthy who came not long after Mr.
Cassidy, whose daughter was the mother of our late townsman,
Timothy Downey. Quite a number came both before
and soon after 1850, including Timothy and John Quinlan in
1849, John O’Brien in 1851, and not far from those dates Jeremiah
Murray, John Murray, Timothy Regan, Wm. O’Brien,
Timothy Lynch, James Ready, Timothy Hurley, James Lynch,
James Burns, Barney Sullivan and others. For many years
the number of Catholics in Plymouth was insufficient to maintain
a church, and father Moran of Sandwich, where the glass
works had gathered a considerable Irish population, was in the
habit of holding service once or twice in each month in the
town hall and Davis Hall, and elsewhere, until the Catholic
church was erected in 1874.</p>

<p>After the advent of the Irish there was for some years quite a
large German immigration, which found occupation in the
Cordage works at Seaside. The German population, however,
was rather a changeable one, and after a few years of savings,
it largely found its way west, and was followed in Plymouth by
the Italians, French and Portuguese, who, added to the Irish,
now make up nearly one quarter of the population of the town.
The Portuguese have drifted here chiefly from New Bedford
and Provincetown, to which places they found their way in
vessels bringing the first catch of oil landed at the Western
Islands by whale ships from those ports. The effect of this
immigration on Provincetown has been remarkable. The first
time I ever went to that town was in 1836, when I was permitted
as a boy of fourteen to join a party of older persons in
the sloop Thetis, going one day and returning the next. At
that time its population was about two thousand, nearly all
of whom were Cape Cod people, who had moved there to either
engage in the whale or cod fishery, or to keep stores for the
sale of ship chandlery and supplies of all kinds to vessels making
harbor there. A man by the name of Lothrop from some
up Cape town, kept a hotel, and by the aid of loam brought
from distant towns, he was cultivating the only garden in
town. The only street was parallel with the shore, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
fence to fence it was a bed of loose sand, through the middle
of which everybody waded, the women I have heard it said,
having a way of kicking their heels in walking by which they
kept the sand out of their shoes. One of our party asked the
landlord if he could have a horse and ride through the village.
“My dear sir,” said Mr. Lothrop, “there is not a horse owned in
town, but the mail chaise will arrive about six o’clock, and perhaps
the driver will let you have his horse.” During the administration
of Andrew Jackson not only was our National
debt extinguished, but a very considerable surplus revenue
grew up, which in 1836 was divided among the states in the
form of a loan, each state giving its obligation to repay the
loan if ever called for. Massachusetts distributed its share
among the towns, and Provincetown spent her portion in building
plank sidewalks. At the present time the Portuguese constitute
a majority of the population of the town. At the beginning
of the civil war one of the measures proposed for the
relief of the financial straits of the government was a call on
the states for the payment of the loan above mentioned. It
has been stated by Mr. L. E. Chittenden, Register of the Treasury
under President Lincoln, that it was found at that time
that the obligations of the Rebel states had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>One of the important results of the foreign immigration in
Plymouth County, and probably elsewhere has been the solution
of the problem concerning the future of our abandoned
farms. These foreigners, more especially the Portuguese and
Italians, have picked them up one after another, and are prospering,
where their former native owners failed. It must not be
forgotten, while considering changes in population and occupation,
that the abandonment of the fisheries has caused a great
change in the industries of our town. With seventy-three vessels
engaged in the Grand Bank fishery, as there were thirty-five
years ago, our wharves and flake yards presented busy
scenes. The large increase, however, of our coal and
lumber trade, amounting now in the former, to thirty thousand
tons annually, has helped materially to prevent any recent
depreciation of wharf property.</p>

<p>I propose now to speak of the changes which have occurred
within my recollection in carriages and in general methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
travel. I have in an early chapter referred to buggies and
wagons, giving the derivation of their names, and the countries
where they were originally used. The introduction of the
carry-all in Plymouth occurred within my time, and as far back
as I can remember there were only two, one in the stable of
George Drew in Middle street, and the other owned by Bourne
Spooner. It is generally supposed that its spacious interior
gave rise to its name which, however, is really only a corruption
of the name of the French Carriole. A vehicle called a
cab, which is simply an abbreviation of cabriolet came quite
extensively into use in Boston about 1840, but never reached
Plymouth, and in the city has now largely given way to a
four wheeler, which retains the old name. The carriage known
as a hack, brought to America from London, and receiving
the name which there applied to the horse alone, was never
introduced into Plymouth until 1870. At the celebration of the
dedication of the Soldiers’ Monument on Training Green in
1869, the committee of arrangements borrowed one from Geo.
W. Wright of Duxbury, and hired another in Boston. There
is probably no city in the world in which the hack has been
for more than a hundred years in such general use as in Boston.
The superior quality for which Boston hacks have long been
distinguished, has been probably due to the fact that wealthy
families have patronized hack stables rather than keep carriages
of their own, and they wanted the best. I can well remember
when there were not more than four private carriages and
coachmen in Boston, and when nothing in livery was seen on
its streets. About 1850 Mr. Deacon, who built an elegant
mansion at the south end after the style of a French Chateau,
surrounded by a high brick wall, set up a livery, and when his
flunkey first appeared sitting like Solomon in all his glory on
the box, he was followed and hooted at by the boys. The vehicle
for many years in general use was in Boston, as elsewhere,
the chaise. Lawyers and doctors and merchants constantly
used them, and always drove themselves, while before
the days of street cars business men drove every morning into
the city from suburban homes, and put up their horses for the
day in some central stable. I remember stables in Cambridge
street, Bowdoin Square, Howard street, Elm street, Brattle
street, Devonshire street, Franklin street, Federal street, School<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
street, Bromfield street, Bedford street, West street and Charles
street. With the introduction of street cars leading to neighboring
towns, the livery business gradually disappeared, and
the high price of central city lots has left the older sections
of the city with scarcely a place where a horse can be put up
for a night. These stables first found a new resting place in
the extension of Chestnut street on the river side of Charles
street, which Tom Appleton, the Boston wit, called Horse
Chestnut street, but they have gradually extended to localities
farther west. In the process of evolution the wheel has now
turned, and the suburban business men are deserting the street
cars, and, coming to Boston in their automobiles, instead of
chaises, put them up for the day in the grand garage in Park
Square. Again referring to the general use of chaises, I
remember that such men as President Quincy, Lucius Manlius
Sargent, Ebenezer Francis and Jeremiah Mason were frequently
seen driving their chaises, and Mr. Webster often
rode in one over the road from Marshfield to Boston, holding
the reins himself, and having a trunk lashed to the axle. Mr.
Mason, above mentioned, the distinguished lawyer, one day
when riding in his chaise, turned from Washington street into
Spring Lane, and met a truckman coming up with his team.
He was six feet six inches in height, but he always sat in his
chaise so bent as not to appear to be a tall man. The truckman
called out to him to back out, which Mr. Mason was not
inclined to do, as he would have to back up hill, while the
truckman could more easily back down. Mr. Mason said
nothing, but the truckman finally began to swear at him, and
showed a disposition to fight. Mr. Mason becoming a little
angry, began to straighten up and show his size, much to the
astonishment of the man with the team, who called out, “for
God’s sake, Mr., don’t uncoil any more, I’ll get out of the
way.”</p>

<p>The stage derived its name, which it took from the stage
coach of England, from the word stage, meaning a section or
the whole of a road route. The name, however, reached New
England many years before the arrival of the English coach,
and was applied to a carriage of very different construction.
The New England stage in the early part of the last century
was a long covered wagon hung on leather thorough-braces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
and contained seats without backs, which were reached by
climbing over the seats in front. In 1801, according to the
Farmer’s Almanac, there were twenty-five lines of coaches running
out of Boston, most of which started from the King’s Inn
on the corner of Exchange street and Market Square. The
stages running to Cambridge and Roxbury and Brookline,
made each two trips a day, and the stage to Plymouth made
three trips a week by the way of Hingham, being ten hours on
the road. The South Boston and Dorchester turnpike running
as far as Neponset River, was incorporated, March 4,
1805, and the Braintree and Weymouth turnpike running from
Quincy to Queen Ann’s Corner in West Scituate, was incorporated
March 4, 1803. Thus a new route was opened by the
last named turnpike, over which the fast line ran every day,
while the mail line ran every alternate day through Hingham.
Until the Old Colony Railroad was opened these turnpikes
were toll roads. After a few years the clumsy stage gave way
to the well known English coach made with the addition of
a middle seat with an adjustable back strap. With the exception
of the English post carriage a sort of a barouche
drawn by two horses, one of which was ridden by a uniformed
postilion, I have never found a more comfortable
and attractive traveling carriage. In 1846 I rode
with the coachman on one of these coaches from Glasgow
to Carlisle, ninety miles, in nine hours, with the four
horses on the gallop, and never leaving the centre of the track.
The red coated guard occupying a seat at the back of the coach,
warned with his horn every team to clear the road, and when
passing a post office he threw off a mail pouch and took another
from a hooked rod, held up by the master of the post.
On approaching a station for change of horses, the guard
gave notice with his horn, and the coachman halting in the
middle of the road, dropped his reins right and left, and four
hostlers, two to unhitch, and two to hitch, would have a new
team ready with a delay of not more than two minutes, the
coachman leaving his seat but once in the nine hours. During
the last years of these coaches the schedule time of a trip from
London to Edinburgh, four hundred miles, was forty hours.
The hansom, which for more than fifty years has been used
in London, has found a difficult entrance into Boston, but is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
now gradually finding its way into use. The fares charged
for them are much lower in London than in Boston. In 1895
I took one at the railway station and rode with a fellow passenger
to Morley’s hotel at Trafalgar Square, nearly three
miles, and paid two and six pence for the two, while in Boston
the charge would have been from two to three dollars.</p>

<p>The introduction of omnibuses in Boston, first used in London,
was very gradual. Having an aunt living in Cambridge,
one of my excursions during my vacation visits in Boston was
to her home, and thus I became early familiar with the methods
of communication with that town. As long ago as I can
remember these omnibuses, taking the place of the old coaches,
made only two or three trips a day, in answer to calls entered
on a slate at the office in Brattle street, picking up passengers
at their houses, and dropping them at their destinations. As
business increased, passengers were obliged to take the omnibuses
at the office, starting at every hour, and thus
they became known as hourlies. Their business was partially
interrupted for a time by the construction of a branch of the
Fitchburg railroad, which had a station about where the law
school is now located, but it was soon abandoned, and the track
was taken up.</p>

<p>As I have begun to speak of matters connected with Boston,
I may as well speak of the changes in that city since my early
boyhood. For this digression I ask to be excused. I was
almost as familiar with Boston, when a boy, as I was with
Plymouth, as I spent nearly every vacation there with my
grandmother who lived in Winthrop Place, which, with Otis
Place, formed a circuitous avenue, entering from and returning
to Summer street. Summer street during my early life
was distinguished, not only for its beautiful shade trees and
elegant houses, but also for its notable residents. Among the
latter whom I remember were, Dr. Jacob Bigelow, Robert C.
Winthrop, Dr. Putnam, Edward H. Robbins, Nathaniel Goddard,
John Wells, Horace Gray, John P. Cushing, Benjamin
Buzzey, Charles Tappan, Edward Everett, Rev. Dr. Nathaniel
Langdon Frothingham, John C. Gray, Benjamin Rich, Rev. Dr.
Alexander Young, Wm. Sturgis, Joseph Bell, Benjamin Loring,
James W. Paige, and Daniel Webster. There also were
Trinity church on the north side, and the Octagon church, Unitarian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
at the junction of Summer and Bedford streets, while
in Winthrop and Otis Place lived Rufus Choate, Abel Adams,
Wm. Perkins, Samuel Whitwell, H. H. Hunnewell, George
Bond, Henry Cabot, Joshua Blake, George Bancroft, Nathaniel
Bowditch, and Israel Thorndike.</p>

<p>When that neighborhood was changed from a residential to
a business one, Winthrop Place was extended across Franklin
street to State street, the whole taking the name of Devonshire
street. From Franklin to Milk street the nucleus of the extended
street was Theatre Alley, so-called, because in the alley
was the stage entrance of the Federal Street Theatre. The
Catholic church, which stood on the south side of Franklin
street, was taken down to make way for the extended street.
Ma’am Dunlap’s famous cigar, snuff and tobacco store, which
every gentleman in Boston knew, partly on account of the
quality of her goods, and partly on account of the beauty of
her daughter Rachel, stood on the west side of the alley. Boston
has always been famous for its alleys, at least fifteen of
which I remember. They furnished very convenient cut
shorts for those who were in a hurry, or did not wish to encounter
undesirable friends. Mr. Choate, whose office was
on the southerly corner of Court and Washington streets, lived
at different times at the United States hotel, in Edinboro street
and Winthrop Place, and in going home he invariably went
down State to Devonshire street, and thence through Theatre
Alley and Catholic Church Alley. The Alley from State
street to Dock Square, now called Change Alley, was formerly
called Flagg Alley, taking its name from its pavement of flagstones,
which again took their name from Elisha Flagg, who
about 1750 opened a quarry in Grafton, and furnished Boston
and some other New England towns with slabs of that description.
For some unknown reason alleys seem to have been
peculiar to seaport places like Provincetown, Salem, Marblehead,
Newburyport and Plymouth, in the last of which were
in my day, Thomas’s Alley, Cooper’s Alley, LeBaron’s Alley,
Spooner’s Alley and Clamshell Alley, all of which remain
except Thomas’s Alley on the south side of the estate of Col.
Wm. P. Stoddard, which was closed some years ago, under an
agreement with the town.</p>

<p>On the south side of Franklin street, until about 1800, known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
as Barrell’s pasture, extending from the Catholic Alley, now
Devonshire street, up to Hawley street, there was a single
block called the Tontine block, such as we ought to see more of
in Boston today. It was designed by Charles Bulfinch, and
contained sixteen dwelling houses, with a front curved to correspond
to the curve of the street, and built with a palace front,
two houses at each end projecting about six feet, and the
centre carried up higher than the rest of the building, and
built over three arches, a central arch for a street called Arch
street to pass through, and one smaller arch on each side over
the Arch street sidewalks. A door under the arch led up to
the old Boston Library, which is still in existence with a home
in Boylston Place. The block was built on the Tontine plan,
with a certain number of owners, the property descending to
the survivors. After some years its tontine feature was
abandoned and the property divided among the survivors.</p>

<p>All through my boyhood, Franklin, Federal, Atkinson, now
called Congress, Pearl, High, Purchase, South, Lincoln, Summer,
Arch, Winter, Tremont, West, Bedford, Chauncy, Boylston,
Essex and Kingston streets, Otis Place, Winthrop Place
and Fort Hill were occupied by dwelling houses. Fort Hill,
which rose about twenty-five or thirty feet above Pearl street,
was cut down in 1865, and High street extended across it.
Pemberton hill, the residence of Gardner Greene, was cut down
in 1835 to its present level, and Pemberton Square laid out for
houses. The estate covered by Pemberton hill was a famous
historic estate. It was occupied by Sir Harry Vane in 1636,
by Rev. John Cotton and his son Seaborn, John Hull, Wm.
Vassall, Madame Hayley, the society leader in Boston, Jonathan
Mason, and Gardner Green. The house of Mr. Green,
which was taken down in 1835, was built by Mr. Vassall in
1760. When the hill was levelled, a rare tree called the
Gingko, brought from China, was removed to the Common,
slips from which are now standing on the grounds of Jason W.
Mixter and B. F. Mellor in Plymouth.</p>

<p>When the city government decided to remove the hill
Patrick T. Jackson, in behalf of the city, made a contract with
Asa G. Sheldon of Wilmington to perform the work and fill
the flats north of Causeway street. Mr. Sheldon moved the
Gingko tree to a spot on the Common near the Beacon street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
mall on a stone dray drawn by oxen, driven by Waterman
Brown of Woburn.</p>

<p>Washington street, once called the Neck, was until 1786 the
only way in and out of Boston. South Boston, then a part
of Dorchester, could only be reached by the way of Roxbury;
and Cambridge could not be reached except by ferry, only
by going through Roxbury and Brookline. The Charles River
Bridge Company was incorporated March 9, 1785, and built
the old Charlestown bridge, which was opened June 17, 1786.
This bridge furnished a new and convenient route to Cambridge.
The West Boston Bridge Company was incorporated
March 9, 1792, and built the bridge extending from Cambridge
street, which was opened November 23, 1793. These
two bridges continued as toll bridges until January 30, 1858.
Dorchester Neck, now known as South Boston, was annexed
to Boston, March 6, 1804, then having only ten families, and
on the same date the South Bridge Co. was incorporated. The
Dover street bridge was built by that company, and opened
Oct. 1, 1805, and was sold to the city April 19, 1832, and made
free, tolls having been charged up to that time. Canal bridge
now Craigie’s Bridge, a toll bridge, leading to East Cambridge,
was built by a company incorporated Feb. 27, 1807, and after
its purchase by the state, was made free January 30, 1858. On
the 14th of June, 1814, Isaac P. Davis, Uriah Cotting and Wm.
Brown, and their associates, were incorporated as the Boston
and Roxbury Mill Corporation, who built the mill dam leading
from Beacon street to Brookline, over which a road was
opened July 2, 1821. This was a toll road, and during my
college life the toll gate was located a little east of Arlington
street, and tolls were collected until it was laid out as a highway,
Dec. 7, 1868. The Boston Free Bridge Corporation was
incorporated March 4, 1826, and built the South Boston
Bridge, which crossed Fort Point Channel at Sea street, and
was bought by the city September 16, 1828, and called Federal
street bridge. The Warren Bridge Corporation was incorporated
March 11, 1828, and opened Dec. 25, in that year.
It was assumed by the state in 1833, and made free in 1858.</p>

<p>Between the toll gate on the Mill Dam and Brookline there
were no houses, and what is now called the Back Bay extended
from the Mill Dam to Washington street. In this connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
the statement may be interesting that in 1830 the pasturage
of cows on the Common was for the first time forbidden
by a city ordinance.</p>

<p>When I was ten years old, my great uncle, Isaac P. Davis,
who was born in 1771, and who as one of the corporators of
the Mill Dam, was familiar with that neighborhood, took me
one day down to the corner of Boylston street and Charles
street, and said to me, William, here was the original bank of
Charles River, and on this spot the British embarked for
Charlestown on the morning of the battle of Bunker Hill. I
was also told by one of the building committee of Trinity
church, that in driving piles to support the foundation, the bed
of an old channel was found where hard bottom could not be
reached, and the expedient was adopted of clearing away the
earth between the piles several feet down and filling the space
with cement, thus holding them from the top instead of supporting
them at the bottom. On this foundation, containing
either five thousand piles at a cost of $7 each, or seven thousand
at a cost of $5, I have forgotten which, the structure stands
without a crack, to show any settling. If an X ray could
penetrate the sub-surface of the Back Bay, it would disclose
thousands of piles with a composite between, of old hats, bonnets,
shoes, hoop skirts and tomato cans on which stand the
domiciles of wealth and fashion. Perhaps, however, such a
foundation is as genuine and real as that on which stands fashion
itself. In my youth the South Bay, east of Washington
street, was open to the harbor through Fort Point channel, only
obstructed by the Dover street, and the old South Boston
bridges. At that time the yards of the houses in Purchase
street extended to the water, and Atlantic Avenue, north of
Dewey Square, was built along the harbor margin. Thus within
my recollection, there have been added between the Mill
Dam and Washington street, Boylston street, Huntington,
Columbus, Atlantic, Shawmut and Harrison avenues, all built
where once was water, and adding more than eight hundred
acres of made land to the old peninsula of Boston, which contained
only six hundred and ninety. Until 1852 the Commonwealth
owned 2,453,730 square feet of land in the Back Bay,
which in that year it began to have filled with the view of selling
it. At that time it was estimated that the land was worth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
less the cost of filling, $906,516.00. The conservatism of this
estimate is shown by the fact that in 1872 $3,551,514 had
been received from sales, or $2,044,294 taking out the
cost of filling, and 500,000 square feet remained unsold,
valued at $750,000, leaving a profit to the Commonwealth of
$1,887,178. In view of the probably speedy and profitable
sales of this land, the question came up in the legislature of
1859, when I was a member of the Senate, whether it would not
be well to devote a part of the proceeds of these sales to educational
purposes, and petitions were presented looking to this
end, which were referred to the committee on education, of
which I was chairman. After several hearings I drew up a report
at the request of the committee, and after I submitted it to
the legislature, the daily papers paid it the unusual compliment
of printing it in full. Resolves accompanied the report,
giving $100,000 to the Museum of Natural History and Comparative
Zoology in Cambridge, fifty thousand dollars to Tufts
college, and $25,000 each to Amherst and Williams colleges,
and the Wilbraham academy, and in addition a substantial
amount to enlarge the school fund of the state. Against some
opposition the Resolves were passed by both branches of the
legislature, and it has always been a source of satisfaction to
me that I was in some degree instrumental in prosecuting to a
successful issue a measure so plainly conducive to the best
interests of the state.</p>

<p>One of the most striking changes in Boston within my time,
has been the change in the location of meeting houses from
those localities where they were once marked features, to the
newer parts of the city. While many of the meeting houses
which stood sixty years ago in Purchase street, Summer street,
Hollis street, Cambridge street, Chambers street and Hanover
street, have been abandoned, and others in Federal street,
Franklin street, Summer street, Washington street and Essex
street have been replaced by new, no less than twenty-five have
been built in sections which in 1840 were covered by water.
Thus the money changers, instead of being driven out of the
temple, have driven the temples away from the haunts of trade.</p>

<p>In recalling these recollections of Boston, to which I have
merely glanced, it seems to me that I have witnessed its
growth from youth to age. There are other evidences of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
growth than those to which I have alluded. I was told many
years ago by Edwin Rice, a resident in East Boston, which now
contains a population of thirty thousand, that when he settled
there its population did not exceed a hundred. I recall sitting
one calm summer afternoon nearly seventy years ago on the
grassy bank of Noddles Island, as East Boston was called,
now covered with a dense population, and listening to the roar
of the city across the harbor. I do not remember to have
heard it before or since. The experience was an interesting
one. There was no single distinguishable sound, but the rattle
of wheels on the pavement, the footfall of horses on the bridges,
the hammer on the anvil, the drum of a passing band, the
cries of street venders, and, perhaps the rustle of trees and
the voices of boys at play, all mingled in a continuous rumble
of a busy, populous city. It has been stated that during the battle
of Waterloo the people of Brussels heard neither the rattle
of musketry, nor the booming of cannon, but both were combined
in an unbroken roar of the battle field. In recalling that
summer afternoon at East Boston, I have thought that the
voices of the past, not the voice of this man or that, performing
his part in the drama of life, but the voices of all good and
great men who have lived and died need time and distance
to be blended as a harmonious whole in the grand symphony of
civilization.</p>

<p>In 1832 the whole of East Boston, containing 663 acres of
upland and marsh with the flats contiguous thereto and one
house, was bought by Wm. H. Sumner, Stephen White, Francis
J. Oliver and others for about $80,000, and the East Boston
corporation was soon after formed. From that time it rapidly
grew, attracting a large population, and becoming a hive of
industry. Before the civil war two hundred and thirty or
more vessels had been built on its shores, with a measurement
of more than two hundred thousand tons. Ship builders
were drawn there from the shallow waters of Duxbury, the
North river and other places, among whom the chief were
Samuel Hall, Donald McKay, Daniel D. Kelly, A. &amp; G. T.
Sampson, Jackson &amp; Ewell, Paul Curtis, Jarvis Pratt, Brown,
Bates &amp; Delano, Robert E. Jackson, Andrew Burnham, Brown
&amp; Lovell, Hugh R. McKay, G. &amp; T. Boole, Wm. Hall, Pratt &amp;
Osgood, Samuel Hall, Jr., Joseph Burke, Wm. Kelly, Otis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
Tufts, Burkett &amp; Tyler, C. F. &amp; H. D. Gardiner; E. &amp; H. O.
Briggs. There Donald McKay built the fleet of ships which
made his name famous. The following is, I believe, a correct
list of his vessels:</p>

<p>The total tonnage of the above, forty-six ships, was 67,041,
averaging 1,457. The greatest achievements of these vessels
were the passage of the Flying Cloud, Capt. Cressey, from New
York to San Francisco in 89 days, and the run by the Sovereign
of the Seas of 430 geographical miles in 24 hours.</p>

<p>Some of the customs prevailing in my youth and early manhood
may be as interesting as the topographical changes in Boston.
There was no day police established in Boston until 1854,
and old Constable Derastus Clapp stationed in and about State
street, was the only officer ever seen. In the above year a police
force, under the direction of a chief, was established, but not
uniformed until 1856. I remember that the newspapers on a
day after the 4th of July, commented with pride on the quiet
and peaceful dispersion of the crowd on the Common, witnessing
the fireworks the evening before, without a police officer to
keep them in order. There were only night watchmen with
their rattles who cried the hour with “All is well.” They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
wore in cool weather plaid camlet cloaks, and as there was a
city ordinance forbidding smoking in the streets, which by the
way has never been repealed, I have many a time when meeting
them concealed my cigar until they were out of sight. My
readers may not be aware that a by-law was adopted in Plymouth
in 1831, which is still in force, forbidding smoking in any
street, lane or public square, or on any wharf in the town.</p>

<p>Ringing the bell at various hours during the day and evening
for the convenience of the inhabitants, has so far as Plymouth
is concerned, been confined to the town sexton. Since,
however, the ringing has been detached from the duties of a
sexton proper, who was an officer of the church, the name sexton
in our town is now given to the bell ringer, who continues
to be chosen by the town every year, though he has now no connection
with the church. The first mention of a sexton in the
town records is under date of 1712, when Eleazer Rogers was
chosen “to ring the bell, sweep the meeting house, keep the
doors and windows of said meeting house shut and open for
the congregation’s use upon all occasions, and carefully look
after said house as above said.” In 1714 he was required
to ring the bell at nine o’clock every evening. From
that time to this a town sexton is chosen each year, who since
the severance of the First Church from the town no longer
rings the bell for church, while each church has its own sexton
for that duty. The custom in Plymouth is to ring the
Town bell as follows at 7 a. m., 12 noon, 1 p. m. and nine p. m.,
all the year; 6 p. m. when the sun sets after that hour, and on
Saturdays 5 p. m., instead of 6. This custom of bell ringing
existed in Boston, as well as other places, and I have heard
it stated that the Old South Church bell was rung as late as
1836 at 11 a. m. to announce “the grog time o’ day.” The
nine o’clock evening bell had its origin in the ancient curfew
bell, which derived from the French words, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvre feu</i>,”
was rung at an hour when the fires in houses should be covered
up. It was adopted in New England merely to indicate the
hour.</p>

<p>There was a method in Boston of lighting the street lamps,
which was primitive. The city was divided into districts, and
a lamplighter was appointed for each district. The lamps
were all oil lamps until 1834, and each lighter would start from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
home in the morning carrying a ladder, a can of oil, and a filled
and trimmed lamp. He would take the old lamp out of the
first lantern, putting the fresh one in its place. He would
then fill and trim the lamp he took out and go on to the next
lantern, and so on through his district. There was another
custom, so far as I know peculiar to Boston, where domestic
life was less extravagantly and luxuriously enjoyed than in
New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Few families kept men
servants, and many gentlemen, rather than impose the work
of blacking boots on servant girls, or have blacking in the
house, fell in with a plan suggested by the Brattle street negroes.
For many years the shops on the south side of that
street were chiefly occupied by shoe blacks and negro dealers
in second hand clothing. Some of these negroes went about
on the first of January and secured lists of subscribers for their
work for the year as a milkman or an ice man would for his
milk or ice. If, for instance, he was a beginner in the industry,
he would start out early in the morning with two rods
about eight feet long, and an inch or more in diameter, and
calling at the house of the first subscriber, take his boots and
stringing them by the tugs on a rod like herrings on a stick,
go the rounds of his subscribers, and the next morning exchange
the clean boots for soiled ones. A more general employment
of men servants, and finally boot black shops and
stands put an end to this custom.</p>

<p>The changes in the militia system of Massachusetts within
my memory have been great, but in my judgment not materially
for the better. There are always those who are anxious to
tinker existing methods of doing things and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>and the organization of the militia has not escaped their
meddlesome hand. Under the militia law in force when I was
a boy, every man between the ages of eighteen and forty-five
was enrolled, and was required to appear at an annual inspection
and drill. The volunteer militia and some specified persons,
were exempted from this service. These enrolled men
were called militia men, and on the day fixed by law those in
Plymouth appeared on Training Green, and after being duly
inspected, were generally dismissed. But this was not invariably
the case. I remember one year when a newly chosen captain
determined to exact of his company all the duties, which
the spirit, if not the letter, of the law required. Much to the
discomfort of his men he marched them through town and
nearly out to Seaside, and made it known that the legal fine
would be imposed on all delinquents. I have a distinct recollection
of their march up North street, their line extending in
single file from Water to Court street. The younger men in
the ranks enjoyed the fun, each carrying his musket as was
convenient to himself, and some wearing knapsacks of domestic
manufacture, displaying devices intended to excite the
applause of the accompanying crowd. Apples and peanuts
were freely indulged in, while long nine cigars and pipes of
extraordinary proportions left a trail of smoke like the steam
from a locomotive. It was not, however, the law, but the
method of enforcing it, which made the annual inspection a
farce, and if it be necessary to inculcate a martial spirit in the
community and maintain a volunteer militia, it would be well
to revive the old law and re-establish the old militia from which
volunteers could be drawn.</p>

<p>Under the old system, the volunteer militia was in a healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
condition, and was at the height of its glory when the Civil
War broke out. It was divided into divisions, brigades and
regiments, and for many years there were in Plymouth an infantry
and an artillery company; an infantry and artillery
company in Abington, and infantry companies in Carver,
Plympton, Halifax, Middleboro, Bridgewater, and I think
Hingham. There were in those days annual brigade or regimental
musters, and the musterfield in Plymouth was what is
now the Robbins’ field, opposite to the house of Gideon F.
Holmes. Those musters were great occasions for the boys,
and we were always on hand, not caring whether school kept or
not. We carried out our programme for the day to the minutest
detail. We were on hand in Town square when the Carver
company abandoned their wagons and began their march to
the tented field. We then inspected the caparisoned horses
of Col. Thomas Weston of Middleboro and his staff in the
yard of Bradford’s tavern, and when under escort of the Standish
Guards and the Plymouth Artillery, they marched to the
music of the Plymouth Band, we followed, and perhaps
reached the field in time to witness the arrival of the Halifax
Light Infantry and the Plympton Rifle Rangers. A few cents
in our pockets were sufficient to carry us through the day.
The company drills, the dress parade and the sham fight received
our careful attention, and the casualties in the last were
on one occasion less than they would have been had not a ramrod
fired by a careless soldier found a target in a distant barn.
When I recall my experience at muster I am reminded of a
remark made by Edward Trowbridge Dana, a brother of the
late Richard H. Dana, after a service at the old Trinity church
in Summer street, in Boston, in which Bishop Eastburn officiated.
The Bishop was an Englishman, a handsome man, and
splendid horseman, whom I have often seen riding in Boston
streets wearing top boots, and looking as if he had been
accustomed to following the hounds. He was as showy in
the pulpit as in the saddle, and impressed his hearers more by
his voice and gestures than by the matter of his discourse. On
the occasion referred to, Dana, when asked by a friend on
coming out of church, how he liked the Bishop, replied, “I feel
as I used to when a boy on the muster field, belly full of watermelon,
and head full of bass drum.” It was at one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
musters above referred to held in Dedham that a new, slangy
name was introduced. It was when the temperance
movement was active, and the sale of intoxicating
liquor was kept as much as possible out of public
sight. One of the side show tents at the muster in question
exhibited over its entrance a large canvass bearing a picture
of a striped pig, which could be seen for a fee of ninepence.
This new zoological specimen attracted great attention, and
crowds learned novel lessons in Natural History. The exit
from the tent was in the rear, and it was observed that every
zoological student came out wiping his lips, while a large number
returned for a second sight of the “critter.”</p>

<p>I have said that at the time the Civil War broke out the
volunteer militia was in its prime. Under the law each company
furnished its own uniforms, while the state furnished to
the privates arms and equipments. Such men as George T.
Bigelow, afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial
Court, Lincoln Flagg Brigham, afterwards Chief Justice of
the Superior Court, Ivers J. Austin, John C. Park, and Elbridge
Gerry Austin, attorneys at law, Newell A. Thompson,
merchant, and Charles O. Rogers, editor of the Boston <cite>Journal</cite>,
were captains of companies. With a population in the state
of less than thirteen hundred thousand, the militia force was
5,593 officers and men, while in 1905, with a population of
three millions, it is no larger, which is equivalent to a falling
off of fifty per cent. The idea underlying the plan of the reformers
of the militia was to bring it up to the standard of
the regular army, which any practical man must see cannot be
done, with volunteer enlistments, small pay and an exaction of
service which busy men cannot afford to render. The first blow
struck at the life of the militia by the meddlers, was to make
the regiment instead of the company the unit of organization,
and have all the companies in the regiment uniformed alike.</p>

<p>Under this system the individuality of the company was
lost at once, its pride and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> were extinguished.
Even the names of company commanders became practically
unknown, and as galley convicts are known by their number,
the companies were only known by their letter. Before
the war every boy in Boston knew the New England Guards,
the City Guards, the Boston Light Infantry, and the Fusileers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
and as each paraded in the streets, every man was ambitious
to have his company excel in numbers, in dress, and in march.
On one occasion the Boston Light Infantry with Dodworth’s
Band marched up State street one hundred and seventeen
strong, and the next day the City Guards with the Brigade Band
marched up the same street with one hundred and eighteen in
the ranks. The flourishing condition of the Independent Corps
of Cadets, shows what the Volunteer Militia might have been
without the so-called reform to which I have alluded. The
death blow to the volunteer militia was struck when the present
armory law was enacted. The requirement that towns, in
which companies are chartered, shall furnish armories, has extinguished
the militia in the towns, in only five of which, out
of three hundred and twenty-one, companies now exist. To
make the army law the more destructive in its effect on the militia,
the most extravagant demands were made by the authorities
for accommodations, in many instances including the equipment
of club houses, which towns with a due view to economy
were not disposed to meet. Aside from all other considerations
the armory law is not only oppressive in its operations, but it
violates the underlying principles of our constitution, to wit:
equality of taxation and the enactment of equal laws, inasmuch
as it imposes for the support of a state institution, burdens on
a few towns and exempts all the rest. It is not an answer to
this objection to say that towns incurring armory expenses receive
certain reimbursements from the state, inasmuch as the
reimbursement ceases with company disbandments, and towns
losing it are left with an armory on their hands for the erection
of which they have incurred large expense; and inasmuch,
also, as the towns maintaining armories, are also taxed for
their share of the reimbursements. It is not a rash prophecy
that if the present militia laws continue in operation, not many
years will elapse before militia organizations will be confined
to the cities of the Commonwealth. In closing the foregoing
narrative concerning the militia, it will be proper to refer
more particularly to the Plymouth volunteer companies. The
Plymouth Artillery was organized January 7, 1777. Thos.
Mayhew was the first commander, and as far as I have been
able to ascertain, it was commanded afterwards until its disbandment
about the year 1850 by the following captains: Geo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
Drew, 1804-09; Wm. Davis, 1810-15; Southworth Shaw, 1816-20;
John Sampson, 1821-24; Nathaniel Wood, 1825; Joseph
Allen, 1826-29; David Bradford, 1830-32; Eleazer Stephens
Bartlett, 1833-35; Wm. Parsons, 1836-39; Ephriam Holmes,
1840-41; David Holmes, 1842; Wendell Hall, 1843-45; Samuel
West Bagnall, 1846-47; Ebenezer S. Griffin, 1848; and Lt.
Robert Finney, 1849. The field pieces furnished to the company
by the state were kept for many years in a gun house located
by permission of the town on the northeast corner of
Training Green, which on the disbandment of the company
was sold to Henry Whiting, Jr., who made of it the house in
which he lived and died on the east side of Sandwich street,
next to the south corner of Winter street.</p>

<p>The Standish Guards was chartered in 1818, and its commanders
up to the time of its disbandment in 1883 were:
Coomer Weston, Bridgham Russell, James G. Gleason, John
Bartlett, Wm. T. Drew, Jeremiah Farris, Coomer Weston, Jr.,
Barnabas Churchill, Benjamin Bagnall, Sylvanus H. Churchill,
Charles Raymond, Joseph W. Collingwood, Charles C. Doten,
Josiah R. Drew, Stephen C. Phinney, Herbert Morissey and
Joseph W. Hunting. The present Plymouth company was
chartered in 1888, and attached as Company D to the Fifth
Regiment. In 1770 a powder house was built by the town at
the northwesterly end of Burial Hill, which was removed within
the memory of the present generation. It was intended as
a place of deposit for powder belonging to the town, but a
vote was passed by the town requiring all powder brought into
town by any person to be placed in it, excepting amounts not
exceeding fifty pounds in the hands of any trader, and twenty
pounds in the hands of any other inhabitant. The tablet containing
an inscription, which was originally placed in the wall
of the building is now in Pilgrim Hall.</p>

<p>I do not intend to say much more concerning Boston, but as
every eastern Massachusetts person looks on that city as his
own, I have ventured to say more than I otherwise would. Until
about the time of the Revolution there were no sidewalks
in the city, and most of the streets were paved with cobble
stones and sloped toward the centre, thus forming a surface
drain. That style of street was rather Dutch than English,
and may still be seen in Holland. It was universal in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
York until the middle of the eighteenth century, when Madam
Provost laid down flagstones called walking-sides, for the
convenience of visitors to her business offices. The surface
drainage above referred to was universal in Plymouth until
after South Pond water was introduced in 1855, when the
numerous wells in town were converted into cesspools, and initiated
the first step in the present sewage system of the town.</p>

<p>Before leaving Boston a few words about its theatres and
its harbor and navigation will not be out of place. The first
theatre was established in 1792 in Hawley street, but though
its representations were advertised as moral lectures, it was
suppressed as violating the law. The law was repealed in the
same year, and on the 3rd of February, 1794, the Federal street
theatre, on the corner of Franklin and Federal streets was opened,
and burned in 1798. It was at once rebuilt and reopened
in the same year, continuing until 1833, under various managers
as a popular resort. During its career Edmund Kean, Macready,
J. B. Booth, and John Howard Payne, appeared on its
stage, and in 1832 I attended a performance there by the Ravels
in a play called “The Skaters of Smolenska,” of
which I have a vivid recollection. In later years I
had the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with John Howard
Payne, who at the age of twenty created a sensation
in the theatrical world under the soubriquet of the youthful
Roscius, and who later was the author of “Sweet Home.” He
was born in Easthampton, Long Island, June 9, 1792, and appeared
at the Park theatre in New York, February 24, 1809,
as “Young Norval.” On June 4, 1813, he appeared at the
Drury Lane Theatre in London. He left the stage after a
few years, but remained in London engaged in writing plays,
among which were “Brutus,” which still holds its place on the
stage, “Therese” and “Charles the Second.” He also wrote
“Clari, or the Maid of Milan,” which was produced as an
opera, and contained the song which gave him special distinction.
In 1832 he returned to the United States, and in 1841 was
appointed Consul at Tunis. On his removal from office by Polk
in 1846, he started for home, but lingered in Paris while efforts
were making for his restoration to the Consulate. In the autumn
of that year I formed an acquaintance with him, which
became intimate. We were in the habit of dining together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
frequently at Tavernier’s restaurant in the Palais Royal, and
one day while we were strolling through the quadrangle of the
Palais where fountains were playing, bands performing, and
children amusing themselves, he called my attention to a round
window in the rear attic of the Palais, where, separated from
the main building, rooms were let for various purposes, and
said, “In that room with a scene like this before my eyes, I
wrote ‘Home Sweet Home.’” He further said that he had come
over from London discouraged, in want and almost in despair,
and with the thought of home the words came to his lips and
were uttered like a sigh for the scenes of his youth, which he
feared he should never see again. He was restored to his
Consulate, and died in Tunis, April 10, 1852. How easy it is
to imagine him looking from that window on the gay scenes
below and uttering the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“An exile from home, pleasure dazzles in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, give me my lowly thatched cottage again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The birds, singing sweetly that came to my call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me them and that peace of mind dearer than all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His body was brought home and buried, I think, in Washington.</p>

<p>In 1827 the Tremont theatre was built and opened on the
24th of September. In 1842 it was sold to the Baptist Society,
of which Rev. Dr. Colver was pastor. In 1831 a building
on Traverse street, known as the American amphitheatre
was built by W. and T. L. Stewart, which was opened in July
as the Warren Theatre, but replaced in 1836 by the National
Theatre, which was burned in April, 1852. It was again rebuilt,
and finally destroyed March 24, 1863. In January, 1836,
the Lion Theatre was opened on Washington street, on the site
of the present Keith’s Theatre, and later as the Melodeon, was
the scene of performances by Macready, Charlotte Cushman
and others. In 1841 the Eagle Theatre was built on the corner
of Haverhill and Traverse streets, but was soon abandoned.
In 1841 the Boston Museum was established on the corner
of Tremont and Bromfield streets, and in 1846 was removed to
the site which it recently occupied north of King’s Chapel
Burial ground. During the Millerite excitement in 1843, the
Miller Tabernacle was built on Howard street, and converted
into the theatre called the Howard Athenæum, in 1845. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
was opened October 13 in that year, and was burned in February,
1846, in which year the present Howard Anthenæum
was built. In 1848 the Beach Street Museum was erected, but
had a short life. The present Boston Theatre was built in
1854, and at that time was exceeded in capacity by only six
theatres in the world. To return to the Federal street theatre,
which I have said was abandoned for dramatic purposes in 1833,
the building passed in 1834 into the possession of the Academy
of Music, and was called the Odeon. In 1846 it was leased
for a time again as a theatre, and was afterwards occasionally
used for short seasons by Italian Opera companies, by the Central
Church, and by the Lowell Institute, until it was taken
down in 1852.</p>

<p>In connection with the theatres it will not be out of place
to speak of Concert Hall, which once stood on the corner of
Hanover and Court streets, built about 1750, and taken down a
few years ago to widen the first mentioned street. Before and
during and after the Revolution it was a famous place for concerts,
balls and other entertainments. I have a card of invitation
issued by the officers of the French fleet, then in Boston
harbor, to a ball to be held there. It is printed on the back
of a playing card, showing the straits to which Boston was reduced
during the Revolution. In my boyhood I saw there an
exhibition by Maelzel of his famous diorama of the “Conflagration
of Moscow,” and of his “automaton chess player,”
which beat Boston’s best players, but was finally discovered to
have a small humped-backed dwarf concealed inside. There,
also, I saw an exhibition of legerdemain by a colored man named
Richard Potter, who also exhibited in Pilgrim Hall about 1831.
He was born in Hopkinton, Mass., on the estate of Sir Harry
Frankland, one of whose slaves named Dinah, and brought
from Guinea, was his mother. After attending school he went
to England with a Mr. Skinner of Roxbury, and there learned
the magician’s art. In 1836 Concert Hall was taken by Peter
B. Brigham, and occupied as a hostelry, where could be found
the best oysters and the most famous drinks. He was notable
for the concoction of new alcoholic mixtures, to which he gave
such names as “Tip and Ty,” “I. O. U.,” “Paris White,” “Fiscal
Agent,” “Free Soiler,” “Same Old Coon,” “Clay Smash,”
“Webster eye-opener,” and “Deacon Grant.” He made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
fortune, a large part of which was bequeathed for the erection
of a hospital now building.</p>

<p>It may be asked how, before the introduction of railroads,
the producers in remote sections of New England found a
market. Every valley and hillside yielded bountiful crops,
and every water privilege had its little mill, and of course
the farmer and manufacturer depended for returns from their
labor on the markets of the seaboard. The market gardeners of
Waltham and Brighton and Cambridge found no difficulty in
supplying daily the markets of Boston, and the brigs, schooners
and sloops, plying as packets between Boston and the various
ports along the shores of New England, brought to the
metropolis the products of a considerable territory lying along
the banks and head waters of the Penobscot, the Kennebec,
Merrimac and Connecticut rivers. But the large district beyond
the reach of these outlets was obliged to largely depend
on teams and baggage wagons for transportation. While I
was in college, from 1838 to 1842, there was a ceaseless procession
of these teams passing through Cambridge from Vermont,
New Hampshire and distant parts of northern Massachusetts.
They brought butter, cheese, lard, eggs, poultry,
potatoes, apples, cider, hams, pork, shoes, wooden ware, chairs,
and other articles of the field and shop, and returned with supplies
needed at home. Teamsters put up their teams at one of
the numerous taverns in the immediate neighborhood of Boston
and, discharging their freight in the city early the next
morning, reloaded their wagons and returned to their putting
up place, starting for home the next day. The taverns, which
depended for support almost entirely on these teamsters, were
the Norfolk House in Roxbury, the Cattle Fair Hotel in
Brighton, the Punch-bowl in Brookline, Porter’s Tavern in
North Cambridge, and others in Cambridgeport, Medford,
Watertown, Waltham, East Cambridge and Charlestown.
The best known of these were Porter’s and the Cattle Fair,
and hardly a night did they fail to find numerous patrons who
sat around a huge wood fire playing checkers or loosening their
tongues with plentiful libations of mulled wine or flip. In the
vicinity of Porter’s there was for some years a race course,
which afforded to the students of Harvard frequent opportunities
to violate the rules of the college. Both at Porter’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
and the Cattle Fair house weekly cattle fairs were held,
and cattle, horses and sheep and hogs, were sold to customers,
who with fat wallets had come from many scores
of towns to buy. These customers were market men and stable
keepers from towns within a radius of at least fifty miles, and
drove their purchases home over the roads and yarded them
until ready for slaughter or sale. I have heard it said that no
keener eye, or shrewder judgment of the value of a fat yoke
of oxen than those of the late Amasa Holmes of Plymouth
were to be found in the cattle yards of Cambridge and Brighton.</p>

<p>Having referred to the taverns in the vicinity of Boston,
supported by the commerce on the road, and by the cattle fairs,
I am led to speak of the hotel system in Boston, as I remember
it seventy years ago, when the population was eighty thousand.
At that time, omitting only very small taverns, I remember
Doolittle’s Tavern in Cambridge street, the Pemberton House
in Howard street, the Pavilion, the Albion and the Tremont
House in Tremont street, the New England House in Clinton
street, two taverns near Haymarket Square, the American and
Webster Houses in Hanover street, Wilde’s Tavern in Elm
street, the City Tavern in Brattle street, the Stackpole House
on the corner of Milk and Devonshire streets, the Exchange
Coffee House in Congress Square, the Pearl Street House on
the upper corner of Milk and Pearl streets, the Commercial
Coffee House on the lower corner of Milk and Battery March
streets, the Bromfield House on the south side of Bromfield
street, the Marlboro Hotel in Washington street, nearly opposite
Franklin street, the Washington House on the east side
of Washington street, a little south of Milk street, and the
Lamb Tavern on or near the site of the present Boston Theatre.
The United States Hotel which comes a little within the
seventy years, was built by a company not far from 1840 on
land bought of the South Cove Company. The South Cove
Company owned flats bought of the city in 1833, extending
from Essex street to the old Federal street bridge, measuring
about seventy-three acres, and bounded on the west by Harrison
avenue as far as Dover street bridge, including lands which
for many years were the sites of the Boston and Albany and
Old Colony Railroad stations. While workmen were excavating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
for the foundations of the United States Hotel, I remember
seeing in the trench the timbers of an old wharf.
Some of the houses I have mentioned have been historic.
Paran Stevens, who kept the New England House, was engaged
to keep the Revere House, when it was opened in 1844,
and was the landlord later of the Tremont House, the Battle
House in Mobile, and the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York,
in the last of which he made an ample fortune. The Tremont
House was opened by Dwight Boyden in 1829, and with the
exception of Mr. Stevens, he alone made the house profitable.
The United States Hotel was opened and kept some years by
Albert Clark and Ralph W. Holman. Mr. Clark went from
the United States to the Brevoort House in New York, and
retired a millionaire. Up to the time during the Civil War,
when the cost of living was advanced, the highest price per day
for transients was two dollars, but on the claim that the cost
of maintaining a boarder had doubled, the daily charge was
doubled, and consequently the profits were also doubled. In
1845 I boarded at the United States Hotel, and paid for room
and board five dollars a week, and during the winters of 1858
and 1859, while in the Senate, I boarded at the Tremont House
and paid for board and room eight dollars per week. It is
true that the comforts and conveniences in hotels have vastly
improved. It is difficult to realize that at that time a visit to
the lavatory involved in the winter an uncomfortable, if not
dangerous exposure to the outer air. The sewage arrangements
for hotels as for other houses, were entirely inadequate
to the demands of the city, and the vaults were emptied by
teams from Brighton, which were not permitted to enter the
city until ten o’clock at night. In very many private yards
there were pumps in close proximity to these vaults, and it is
a wonder that the health of the city was not seriously impaired.
The teams I have referred to were nightly strung
along on Cambridge bridge, waiting for the hour, and were
called by the college boys, “Brighton Artillery.” The sewage
question was an unsolved one in Boston for many years, and
the necessity of ventilating sewers was little realized or understood.
When water closets and set bowls were introduced, it
was supposed that traps with standing water would prevent
the passage of deleterious gas. It was, however, discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
at last, that while odors might thus be excluded, the dangerous
gases, which were inodorous, could not be kept back by
water. Thus two things became necessary, to wit, individual
ventilators connected with bathroom plumbing, and a proper
ventilation of public sewers. I remember that many years
ago the city Government in response to complaints of water
spouts which discharged their water on the sidewalks, passed
an ordinance requiring all spouts to enter the sewers. The
Board of Health at once protested against the adoption of such
an arrangement on the ground that spouts would discharge
sewer gases through the house gutters in the immediate vicinity
of sleeping room windows; but it was soon discovered that
such a general ventilation of the sewers prevented the formation
of gases, and was a conservator of health.</p>

</div>


<p>I have suggested that some notice would be taken by me of
the changes which have taken place in seventy years in the
marine aspects of Boston. To a nautical eye these changes
have been great. Seventy years ago the wharves from
India wharf to what is now the Gas House wharf, were
occupied by full rigged ships, square rigged brigs, topsail
schooners and sloops, engaged in traffic with the northwest
coast, Valparaiso, China, Calcutta, the Mediterranean,
England, the Western Islands, Nova Scotia, the Penobscot
and Kennebec rivers, Portland, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
the James river, Wilmington, Savannah, Charleston,
New Orleans, and every New England port. There were the
ships Akbah, Atlas, South America, St. Petersburg, Asia, Daniel
Webster, and the brigs, Emerald, Ruby, Topaz and Amethyst
in the European trade; the ships of Bryant and Sturgis in the
northwest coast trade; of Elisha Atkins in the South American
trade; John H. Pearson in the New Orleans trade; Daniel
C. Bacon in the Calcutta trade, and shippers without number
engaged in trade with many American ports. Besides these
there were steamers running to Bangor, Bath and Portland,
and during the summer to Plymouth, Barnstable, Hingham and
Provincetown. The whole wharf front of Boston was not more
than a mile long, but ship’s royal masts and yards exhibited
a tangle of spars in strong contrast with the scene today,
South Boston at that time displayed an expanse of flats now
covered with docks of the greatest capacity. East Boston was
without wharves, and Charlestown outside of the Navy Yard,
added little to the commercial aspect of the harbor. When
the Cunard steamers began to arrive in 1840, there was not a
towboat in the harbor, and when the steamer Brittannia of the
Cunard line was getting ready on her return trip to Liverpool,
set down for February 3, 1844, the harbor was closed solid
with ice, which it was feared would prevent her departure.
But the Boston merchants realizing the importance of holding
Boston as the sailing port of the Cunard company, made a contract
with Gage &amp; Hittinger, a firm largely engaged in cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
ice and shipping it to ports in warm latitudes, to cut a passage
to the sea one hundred feet wide, and seven miles long, through
ice nearly two feet thick. This was done, and the steamer
sailed on schedule time, much to the pleasure and profit of the
Cunard Company, and to the credit of the city. At about that
time the tug boat R. B. Forbes was built by the underwriters,
and was for some years in their service. One of her first opportunities
to render aid was I think, in 1848, when the steamer
Cambria, inward bound from Liverpool, went ashore back of
Truro. One Sunday morning, on my way to church, I met
Mr. George Baty Blake driving into town, who told me that
the Cambria, in which he was a passenger, was ashore, and
that he was on his way to Boston to obtain aid in hauling her
off. I went with him to see the station master, Henry Carter,
and Joseph Sampson, conductor, and in an hour he was on a
locomotive bound to Boston. So expeditiously was Mr.
Blake’s service rendered, that before daylight the next morning
the Cambria had been hauled off by the R. B. Forbes, and
was on her way to Boston. Mr. Blake had been a frequent
Cunard passenger, and told the captain that if he would put
him ashore he would send the R. B. Forbes down.</p>

<p>How things have changed. A ship is now rarely seen, brigs
have disappeared altogether, topsail schooners from Nova
Scotia occasionally visit Boston, and the old packet sloops have
lost the rosewood and bird’s eye maple of their cabins, and
been degraded to uses of which they seem to be ashamed. Now
and then I read on the stern of a weather beaten coal barge
the name of a ship I knew in her prime, which seems to me like
a wing clipped eagle no longer able to soar, or a disembodied
spirit suffering for sins done in the body. In view of the
changes it is thoughtlessly said that the commerce of Boston has
declined, but there can be no greater mistake. It must be remembered
that the tonnage of vessels has largely increased.
The seven masted schooner Thomas W. Lawson alone, with a
carrying capacity of six thousand tons of coal, making ten
trips a year, represents the arrival of one hundred ships of the
carrying capacity of the largest tonnage seventy years ago,
while leaving out of the calculation tramp steamers, the regular
liners with cargoes of two thousand tons each, represent
three hundred more. Coming down to actual statistics, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
customs receipts at Boston have increased from 1901 to 1905,
inclusive, two millions of dollars, and the entering tonnage
during the same time, has increased 456,392. The complaint
of a sluggish condition of our commerce is based on
the fact that our foreign trade is largely in the hands of
aliens. Some seek a remedy in subsidy to American ships,
but the question may be asked whether it will not be well, before
taking a subsidy out of the treasury, a large portion of
which will find its way into the pockets of the steel barons of
Pennsylvania, to try the simpler remedy of taking the duty
from coal and iron, and compelling manufacturers to sell at
home structural steel used in building ships at prices as low
as they sell to foreign ship builders.</p>

<p>Turning now to railroads, whose entire history is covered
by the period of my life, I suppose I may say without the possibility
of a denial, that no invention or discovery has within
seventy years been more effective in developing the resources
of our country, maintaining its integrity, and promoting its
interests than the railroad system. The use of coal has been
too great to be accurately measured, but without railroads
that product of the mines would be still sleeping in its beds.
The telegraph and telephone afford business facilities, which
are thought indispensable, but they are only the inevitable followers
of the railroad, and even depend on its lines for the
stretching of their wires. Without gas or kerosene oil, and
with wood for fuel, we could have still enjoyed life, though
it be without present conveniences, comforts and luxury.
Without railroads it is not too much to say that it would have
been impossible to dispose of, and assimilate that vast immigration
which during the last seventy years has sought a
resting place in our land. It may also be said that the railroad
system, which broke through the wall that separated the old
Union from California, prevented the establishment
of a new and distinct empire on the Pacific coast. Without
attempting even a sketch of the history of the
railroad system, it is sufficient to say that at its introduction
the road bed, motive power and cars were
rude and primitive. The locomotives weighed not far from
eight tons; the cars running on a single truck were built after
the fashion of stage coaches with doors on the sides, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
rails weighed fifty pounds per yard. When Gridley Bryant
of Boston invented the double truck, I was told by his son,
the late Gridley J. F. Bryant, that he was laughed out of the
room of a committee of the Massachusetts Legislature when
he suggested that long cars with two double trucks could safely
run on a curved track. The committee had not learned the
lesson, which the distinguished scientist, Professor Dionysius
Lardner, learned at a later period, that it is never safe to deny
the possibility of anything. In 1838 he declared that ocean
steam navigation was impossible on account of the inability of
any vessel to carry sufficient coal for a trans-Atlantic voyage,
and yet before the year passed, in which the declaration was
made, the steamship Sirius of seven hundred tons and two hundred
and fifty horse power arrived in New York April 23d in
nineteen days from Cork; and on the same day the steamship
Great Western of thirteen hundred and forty tons and four
hundred and fifty horse power, arrived in fifteen days from
Bristol. I feel pretty sure when I deny that two and two make
six, but if anyone should offer to bet with me that within five
years it will be demonstrated that the earth stands still, I should
be afraid to accept the offer. In June, 1827, when the construction
of a road from Boston to Albany was first agitated,
Jos. Tinker Buckingham, the learned editor of the Boston
<cite>Courier</cite>, wrote an editorial for his columns, which contained
the following paragraph:</p>

<p>“Alcibiades, or some other great man of antiquity, it is
said, cut off his dog’s tail, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid nuncs</i> might not become
extinct for want of excitement. Some such motive, we doubt
not, moved one or two of our natural and experimental philosophers
to get up the project of a railroad from Boston to Albany;
a project which every one knows, who knows the simplest
rules in arithmetic to be impracticable but at an expense a
little less than the market value of the whole territory of
Massachusetts, and which if practicable, every person of common
sense knows would be as useless as a railroad from Boston
to the moon. Indeed a road of some kind from here to the
heart of that beautiful satellite of our dusky planet would be
of some practical utility, especially if a few of our national,
public spirited men, our railway fanatics, could be persuaded
to pay a visit to their proper country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>As is well known, the first railroad built in New England
was a short road extending from the Quincy granite quarries
to Neponset River, which was opened Oct. 7, 1826, to be used
with horsepower for the transportation of granite to tide water.
In June, 1830, the Boston and Lowell railroad was incorporated,
and in 1831 the Boston and Providence, and the Boston
and Worcester. I have heard it said that the curves on the
easterly end of the Boston and Worcester were due to the expectation
that horse power would be used, and to the consequent
desirability of as level a track as possible. Though
when the construction of some of the Massachusetts roads was
begun it was planned to run them by horse power, the plan was
changed before the roads were completed. On the Baltimore
and Ohio road, which was begun in 1828, horses were used for
some time, and the station between Baltimore and Washington,
called the Relay House, took its name from the fact that relays
of horses were taken there. In 1830 there were only forty-eight
miles of railroad in the United States.</p>

<p>The Boston and Worcester began to run trains as far as
Newton, May 16, 1834, on a running time of eighteen miles an
hour, and I remember well seeing one of the earliest trains start
from the station which was then in Indiana Place, and I was as
much astonished as I should be while writing these words to
see an air car stop at my roof to receive passengers for Boston.</p>

<p>Some of the early railroads outside of New England were
built with longitudinal sills of timber laid on ties, to which flat
bars of iron from a half to three quarters of an inch thick were
spiked, called strap rails. In the summer of 1843 I went to
Buffalo, passing over roads owned and controlled by I think,
seven distinct corporations; the Boston and Worcester, the
Western, as the road from Worcester to Albany was called, the
Albany and Schenectady, the Schenectady and Utica, the Utica
and Syracuse, the Syracuse and Rochester, and the Rochester
and Buffalo. At that time the cars, instead of being drawn
by the locomotive around Capitol Hill as now, at Albany, were
drawn to the summit of the hill by cables worked by stationary
engines, and there attached to the locomotive. The rail used
at that time on all the above mentioned roads which were in
New York, were strap rails. It was soon found, however, that
these rails became loosened at their butts, and being underrun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
by the wheels peeled up, often running through the car floors
and in some cases fatally injuring passengers. These loose
ends were called snake heads, and were as much to be feared as
the snags on the Mississippi River sixty years ago.</p>

<p>On my return from Buffalo I took a passenger boat on the
Erie Canal from Rochester to Syracuse, and had my first and
only experience on the “raging canawl.” The cabin of the
boat was handsomely fitted up, and had sleeping berths so arranged
as to be unfolded at night. The dinner furnished was
good, and on the whole the novelty of the trip made it interesting.
We were somewhat uncomfortable sitting on deck in
the blazing sun, and when the cry of “low bridge” was called,
obliging us to duck our heads as we passed under the various
highways crossing the canal, I felt like one of the brakemen on
the top of a freight car, liable to be swept off unless I was constantly
on the alert. The rate of speed, not more than three
or four miles an hour, was not especially exhilarating, but the
operation of raising and lowering the locks relieved somewhat
the monotony of the journey, and the opportunity afforded for
an occasional run on the tow path, or a visit to the store of
some shady hamlet for the purpose of purchasing such luxuries
as the larder of the boat was unable to furnish, altogether made
the trip one to be remembered.</p>

<p>It may surprise some of my readers to learn that, in the decade
from 1835 to 1845, the United States was far in advance
of both England and France in the construction of railroads. I
speak from my own knowledge and experience when I say that
after all the main railroad lines in the northern states had been
completed some years, there was no railroad in England north
of York on the east, or north of Manchester on the west. In
the summer of 1846, in making the circuit from York through
Newcastle, Edinburgh, Perth, Dunkeld, the Trossachs, Glasgow,
Carlisle and Lancaster to Manchester, I was obliged to go either
by coach or post carriage all the way. So in France in the
same summer, I found only one section of rail laid between
Boulogne and Paris, and in December of that year not a finished
mile between Paris and Marseilles. Gangs of men, who
were called Navvies, were housed along the line between Lancaster
and Carlisle grading a road bed, and in France I found
on the route from Boulogne to Paris that a device had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
adopted by which the railroad was utilized as fast and as far
as its sections were finished. On the 5th of July, 1846, I left
Boulogne in a diligence for Paris. The railroad from the latter
city had been completed as far as Amiens about sixty miles.
On reaching Amiens the diligence was driven under a crane
with a chain sling attached, and after its body was loosened
from the wheels it was swung round onto a platform car, to
which it was securely attached, and the remainder of the journey
was travelled by rail.</p>

<p>In 1843 a project was started to build a railroad from Boston
to Plymouth, and on the 18th of March, 1844, the Old Colony
railroad was incorporated. A committee appointed by those
interested in the enterprise, consisting of Col. John Sever of
Kingston, Hon. Isaac L. Hedge and Jacob H. Loud of Plymouth,
made a canvas of the towns on the route for the purpose
of estimating the probable annual receipts of the road. In
their report they stated that the Plymouth receipts, including
both to and from Boston, would probably be eighteen thousand
dollars for passengers, but no estimate was made of the probable
freight receipts. They estimated the annual running expenses
to be $46,250, and expressed the opinion that receipts
of $100,000 would pay expenses, and a dividend of six per
cent. on the cost of the road. Their estimate of the cost of
the road was as follows:</p>

<td class="tdr">$752,745</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>When completed, the cost was found to have been $700,000.
The weight of the first locomotives used was fourteen and a
half tons, and the weight of the rails fifty pounds per yard,
while the weight of those now in use is sixty tons for locomotives
and ninety pounds per yard for rails. On the Burlington
route locomotives are now used weighing one hundred and
eighty-seven tons, with tenders carrying twenty-six thousand
pounds of coal, and six thousand gallons of water. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
board of Directors chosen at a meeting held at the Exchange
Coffee House in Boston, June 25, 1844, consisted of John Sever
of Kingston, Addison Gilmore of Boston, Isaac L. Hedge of
Plymouth, Nathan Carruth of Boston, Jacob H. Loud of Plymouth,
William Thomas of Boston, and Uriel Crocker of Boston.
Mr. Sever was chosen president; Mr. Gilmore, treasurer; and
Mr. Loud, clerk. In December, 1844, the same officers were
chosen, and December 31, 1845, the same officers were re-elected,
except that Mr. Sever resigned as president, though remaining
on the board, Mr. Carruth succeeding him as president,
and Josiah Quincy, Jr., succeeding Mr. Gilmore, who resigned
as director, but continued as treasurer. On the 8th of
November, 1845, the road was opened and the Directors
brought a party from Boston to dedicate it, among whom were
Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, Judge John Davis, Josiah
Quincy, Nathan Hale, E. Hasket Derby and P. P. F. Degrand.
A collation had been prepared by the citizens in the lower Pilgrim
Hall, at which Nathaniel Morton Davis presided, and
speeches were made by the above gentlemen. The next day
regular trains began to run twice a day at 7 a. m., and 3.30 p.
m. from Plymouth, and 7.45 a. m. and 4.30 p. m. from Boston,
with a running time of an hour and three quarters, while there
are today eleven trains each way on week days, with various
running times from 1.04 to 1.21, and five trains each way on
Sundays. Until 1847 the road occupied the Boston and Worcester
station in Lincoln street, and then removed to Kneeland
street. The Directors believing that a hotel would be a profitable
feeder to the business of the road, built the Samoset,
which was dedicated and opened March 4, 1846. Joseph Stetson
was employed to keep it, as the agent of the road, but in
compliance with the recommendation of a committee chosen to
investigate the affairs of the company, it was sold about 1850
to an association, as has been stated in a former chapter.</p>

<p>Some years after the incorporation of the Old Colony railroad,
a branch from South Braintree to Fall River was incorporated
as the Fall River railroad, which was consolidated with
the Old Colony railroad, September 7, 1854, under the name of
the Old Colony and Fall River railroad. After the extension
of the road from Fall River to Newport, the name was changed
to the Old Colony and Newport railroad. In 1872 the Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
Cod railroad, extending from Middleboro to the Cape, was annexed,
and the old name of Old Colony was resumed. The
South Shore railroad from Braintree to Cohasset was added
October 1, 1876, the Duxbury and Cohasset from Cohasset to
Kingston, October 1, 1878, and the Fall River, Warren and
Providence, December 1, 1875. The Bridgewater Branch was
built at an early period, and the Middleboro and Taunton
Branch was opened in 1856, the branch by way of Easton to
Fall River in 1871, and the Raynham and Taunton Branch in
1882. As this sketch brings the Old Colony railroad down to
the memory of the present generation, it is unnecessary to pursue
it further.</p>

<p>For twenty years the Old Colony railroad, like all other railroads
in New England, used wood as fuel in their locomotives,
and the lot of land on which the brick block stands, extending
to the shore was constantly filled with piles of wood, which
were kept supplied by Geo. Adams of Kingston, the purchasing
agent. The Providence road, more remote from wood lots,
bought the standing wood on a large tract of land on the James
River, and Franklin B. Cobb was sent one or more years to
superintend its cutting and shipment. Had not coal soon taken
the place of wood it is probable that by this time the forests
of the country would have been exhausted. As it is, the
enormous consumption of railroad ties presents a problem concerning
a continual supply of these indispensable features of
railroad construction which railroad men all over the country
are beginning to seriously consider. There are two hundred
thousand miles of railroads in the United States, which, with
twenty-five hundred ties to the mile, require for their construction
500,000,000 ties, or calling the life of a tie eight years, an
annual supply of 62,000,000. Counting sixteen feet to a tie
the annual repair of two hundred thousand miles of road will
require annually a supply of 992 million square feet. With
all the other uses to which lumber is put in houses, bridges,
vessels, piling, box boards, barrels and wood pulp, to say nothing
of the lumber destroyed by fires, it is easy to see that the
end of our forests is not far off, unless some new material is
discovered to meet the exigency. The Pennsylvania railroad
is experimenting with steel ties, weighing thirteen to a ton, and
costing $2 each, but their inflexibility seriously increases the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
wear and tear of rails and cars, and it is feared that the experiment
will prove a failure. When the Boston and Lowell railroad
was built I feel quite sure that stone ties were used, and
finally abandoned for the reason above suggested. Some railroad
managers in the southwest are trying catalpa wood, which
if its texture shall be found satisfactory, they think may be
planted in large areas and furnish in twenty-five years a crop of
trees, which set four feet apart will grow twenty-five hundred
trees to the acre, or at the rate of two ties to a tree, five thousand
ties. At this rate twelve thousand acres would supply
a sufficient number of ties for a single year. But what
shall be done while these trees are growing, and still another
year’s product of twelve thousand acres will be required,
and after that another and another. All the while the cost of
lumber is increasing. Within seventy years black walnut, before
unknown as a furniture wood, has been so nearly exhausted
as to bring in the Boston market one hundred dollars a
thousand. Our legislators in Washington in their fear of the
lumber barons of Michigan and Maine, who have even sent
their invading axes into the mountains of New Hampshire and
the forests of the Adirondacks, refuse to bring about even the
slight amelioration of present conditions, which by the abolition
of a duty on lumber, might be afforded by giving us access
to the forests of the Dominion. Unlike France, where no
man can cut down the forests on his own land without a government
permit, we of the present generation in the United
States are absolutely skinning the earth, as if future generations
have no rights which we are bound to respect. If seventy
years ago a law had been enacted requiring an acre of
black walnut to be planted with so many trees to the acre, for
every acre cut down, that wood would have continued in reasonably
abundant supply. Unless some restraining laws be
soon enacted to control the robbers of our forests, a lumber
famine must sooner or later ensue.</p>

<p>The only effectual remedy for the existing evil, which I as
a layman can see, is the discovery of a material to be made
from some plant, weed or shrub raised in annual crops. For
want of a better name let us call the material paper. What
the plant or shrub will be, no man as yet knows. It may be
now in our fields and yards growing under our very eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
waiting to be called upon to do its share in the great work of
civilization. It may be possible that with such an annual crop
the farmers of New England will see their hillsides and valleys
once more sources of wealth. It may be possible to mould the
pulp made from this shrub into material of any form or shape
from house lumber and box boards to brush woods, and from
railroad ties to spools, as flexible as wood, as indestructible as
stone, and as incombustible as iron. Fortune and fame await
the discoverer of this material. Young man, look for it, and
you will find it. Who knows that it may not be the daisy—not
the common New England plant, but the daisy which has
been produced by Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, a
combination of the New England, English and Japan daisies,
with stalks two feet long, which would probably yield four tons
to the acre. Such a crop raised annually without constant
planting, and requiring little fertilization, would convert our
hillsides and valleys into mines of wealth, and what is now a
nuisance into an everlasting benefaction.</p>

<p>A few words may be interesting concerning the management
of fires in my youth. Either there were very few fires in
Plymouth during the colonial and provincial periods, or the
record of them is very incomplete. It is known that on the
24th of January, 1620-21, the Common House on Leyden
street caught fire from the lodgment of a spark on its thatched
roof, and was burned to the ground. At a town meeting held
on the fifth of February, 1664-5, it was voted, “to see what
may be collected for the relief of Francis Billington, he having
lately suffered great loss by the burning of his house.” The
house known as the “Crow House” at Seaside, was probably
built in 1665, on the site of the “Billington House.” The only
other fire, of which there is any record before the Revolution, is
referred to in a vote of the town passed March 21, 1757, “that
Thomas Norrington, in consideration of his loss by fire, be
abated his Province, County and Town rates for the last year.”
As there is no record of any house owned by Mr. Norrington,
it is probable that he was a tenant of some house or store, and
suffered the loss of furniture or goods. In Boston, either
more complete records were kept, or there were
many more fires during the periods above mentioned.
In 1654 occurred what was known as the great fire.
In 1676 a fire at the North end consumed forty-five
dwelling houses, the North Church and several warehouses
within a district enclosed by Richmond, Hanover and
Clark streets. On the 8th of August, 1679, a fire occurred
extending from what is now Blackstone street, westerly to Dock
square, and southerly to the present Liberty square, which destroyed
eighty dwelling houses, seventy warehouses, and many
vessels with their cargoes, causing a loss of two hundred thousand
pounds. The main reliance in extinguishing fires at that
time was upon long handled hooks, with which every householder
was required to be provided, and upon large swabs attached
to poles twelve feet long, with which water was splashed
on the walls and roofs. A few pumps and the dock were the
only sources of water supply. All buildings in Boston at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
time were wooden, and at the next session of the General Court
a law was passed providing that no dwelling houses should be
erected in Boston except of stone or brick, and covered with
slate or tile, unless by permission of the magistrates, commissioners
and selectmen. October 1st, 1711, a fire beginning in
Williams Court, burned nearly one hundred buildings, including
the First Church.</p>

<p>In 1778 a fire occurred at the South end, beginning at Beach
street, and extending southerly on both sides of Washington
street, as far as Common street, burning in its course the Hollis
street church; and in 1825 a fire in Kilby street destroyed fifty
stores. The great fire in Boston, which burned from the evening
of the 9th to the 11th of November, 1872, covered about
eighty acres, and extended from Bedford to State street, and
with the exception of a few buildings, from Washington street
to the harbor, causing a loss of about eighty millions of dollars.
Taking into consideration only the fires in Boston before the
Revolution, the number was entirely out of proportion to those
in Plymouth during the same period.</p>

<p>The first fire engine used in Boston with any effect, was
made in 1765 by David Wheeler, a blacksmith, who had his
house and shop on what is now Washington street, a little north
of Bedford street, and between the latter street and what is
now known as Avon place. From the first settlement of Boston
there was a pond belonging to the town abutting Wheeler’s
land, which had been always used as a town watering place, and
which became a nuisance when dwellings were erected in its vicinity,
and was finally sold to Mr. Wheeler in 1753. The first
steam fire engine was introduced into Boston in 1854, and there
are now between thirty and forty in the city.</p>

<p>In 1792 the Massachusetts Charitable Fire Society was organized,
and incorporated in 1794, to relieve sufferers by fire,
and to invent means by which fires might be extinguished. For
many years its anniversary was celebrated by an oration and an
ode. Several of the odes were written by Robert Treat Paine,
Jr., who changed his name from Thomas on account of his
aversion to Thomas Paine, the author of the “Age of Reason.”
The celebrated song, “Adams and Liberty” was written by Mr.
Paine to be sung at one of the celebrations of the Society to the
tune, “To Anacreon in Heaven,” which is now better known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
the tune of the “Star Spangled Banner.” As most of my readers
are probably unfamiliar with this song, I give below one of
its stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye sons of Columbia who bravely have fought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For those rights which unstained from your sires had descended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May you long taste the blessings your valor has bought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And your sons reap the soil which their fathers defended;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Mid the reign of mild peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">May your nation increase,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">With the glory of Rome and the wisdom of Greece,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And no son of Columbia shall e’er be a slave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls a wave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As far as I can learn there was no fire insurance on any
building in Massachusetts until the very last years of the 18th
century. There were no insurance companies in the state until
then, but it is possible that there may have been individuals who
took fire risks as Barnabas Hedge did at a later period in Plymouth.
Until about 1798 or 1799, marine insurance was done
entirely by underwriters, as they were called. A ship owner,
for instance, about to send his vessel to sea, who wished insurance,
would ask a few men of means how large risks each
would take, and they would under write their names on printed
blanks, stating the amounts they would insure. Of course the
establishment of insurance companies put an end to this method
of insurance except in outports like Plymouth, and the name
underwriter was transferred to the companies. My great uncle
Thomas Davis, was the first president of the first marine insurance
company in Boston, from 1798 until his death in 1805, and
I have hanging on the wall in my library, the barometer which
hung in his office.</p>

<p>I have spoken of three fires which occurred in Plymouth during
the colonial period. I am inclined to think that not more
than forty fires have occurred since 1620, causing losses exceeding
five hundred dollars, and that the total loss by fire, exclusive
of fires in the woods, has not exceeded three hundred
thousand dollars. Of all the fires, which have occurred within
my memory I can recall only one in which adjoining buildings
were seriously damaged. While this bears testimony to the
efficiency of the Plymouth fire department, I think that special
mention should be made of the Unitarian Church fire, when
only great skill and persistent effort saved the Bradford house,
the Town house, and the Orthodox church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span></p>

<p>For more than a hundred years Plymouth possessed no special
means of extinguishing fires. On the 27th of January,
1728, it was voted in town meeting “that every householder
shall from time to time be provided with a sufficient ladder or
ladders to reach from the ground to the ridge of such house at
the charge of the owner thereof; and in case the owner or owners
of such house or houses be not an inhabitant of the town,
then the occupiers thereof to provide the same and deduct the
charge thereof out of his or their rent, on pain of the forfeiture
of five shillings per month for every month’s neglect after the
tenth day of January next.” It was also voted that between
the first day of March and the first of December every householder
between Wood’s Lane, now Samoset street, and Jabez
Corner, should keep on his premises a hogshead or two barrels
of water, or a cistern to the value of two hogsheads, exempting,
however, any house standing twenty rods from the highway.
So things went on with only the efforts of citizens to rely on,
and the utmost care in the management of domestic fires, until
the 16th of March, 1752, when it was voted to choose thereafter
annually a board of five firewards; and on the 21st of March,
1757, it was voted to purchase what was called a ‘garden engine’
that would throw about fifty gallons of water a minute.
On the 18th of February, 1765, it was voted that Gideon White,
Wm. Rider, Samuel Cole, Wm. Rickard, Abiel Shurtleff, Zacheus
Curtis, Lewis Bartlett, John May and Wm. Crombie, the
managers of the engine, be exempted from the performance of
all other town duties. In 1770 two engines are referred to in
the records, though there is no mention of the purchase of the
second one, and both were kept in an addition at the easterly
end of the present town house. On the 2d of May, 1798, the
town voted to buy a new engine, and on the 6th of April, 1801,
another, these two taking the places of the two old ones. These
two new engines called respectively Niagara No. 1 and Fountain
No. 2, were bucket engines, and were kept under the Unitarian
Meeting House until it was taken down in 1831, when
the Fountain was removed to a house built on the southwest
corner of Training Green, and the Niagara was removed to a
house near the jail, and later to a house on Russell street. An
engine which was called No. 3, was presented to the town by
Nathaniel Russell, William Davis and Barnabas Hedge, May 5,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
1823, but was disposed of in 1836, when the Rapid was bought,
and took its number. In 1829 the reservoirs in Town and
Shirley squares were built, and in that year Torrent No. 4, a
suction engine, was bought, and in the same year the Niagara
was changed to a suction engine. In 1834 and later, reservoirs
were built at Training Green, in High street and
in Court street at the foot of Russell street and
opposite Pilgrim Hall. The Torrent No. 4 was kept
some years in the Northwesterly end of the Town House,
and afterwards in Franklin street, while the Rapid was removed
to Summer street. At the present time the Niagara built
in 1798, the Fountain built in 1801, the Torrent built in 1828,
and the Rapid built in 1836, are stored in the hospital of the
Fire Department on Spring street, where I hope they will be
permitted to long remain as veterans in the service, and relics
of the past.</p>

<p>The earliest fire of which I have any recollection, was in
1828, when the anchor works, standing where the Plymouth
Mills are now located, were burned. I was then attending
Mrs. Maynard’s school on the corner of Main street and Town
Square, and saw one of the engines go round the corner. In
the same year or the next, before the reservoirs were built, and
before the first suction engine was bought, I remember seeing
two lines of men and women carrying up one line buckets of
water from the dock to a bucket engine at the head of North
street, and carrying empty buckets down the other line back
to the dock. In every house two leather fire buckets handsomely
painted, and bearing the owner’s name, hung in the
front entry, and when the fire bells rang there was a general
panic, and men half dressed and women bareheaded, and with
disordered hair, seized their buckets and ran to the scene of the
fire. In my boyhood the active men at fires were, Joseph
Bradford, Samuel Doten, and Daniel and Isaac C. Jackson, each
with his fire trumpet, calling as the occasion required, “Play
away, No. 4,” or “Play away, No. 1.”</p>

<p>In 1835 an act was passed by the General Court, establishing
the Plymouth Fire Department, under which the selectmen appoint
annually a board of engineers, who now have full charge
of the organization of the department and the management of
fires. In May, 1870, in accordance with a vote of the town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
steam fire engine No. 1 was bought, and in June, 1874, No. 2
was bought and named Jeremiah Farris. In 1893 No. 3 was
bought, and named H. P. Bailey. The question may well
be asked why suction engines were not earlier invented. For
centuries water pumps were used, and the engine only needed
an application of their well known principles to make them
complete. The saying that necessity is the mother of invention,
is only another version of the statement that providence
supplies what the actual wants of the people demand. The
carelessness of men, the cheap methods of building, and the introduction
of new devices for heating houses, have alarmingly
increased the liabilities to fires, and have led to a demand for
better methods of extinguishing them, and lo, the engine appeared
at call. Nor does the steam fire engine mark more
than another step towards more effective machines. The time
is undoubtedly near at hand when the auto engine will take
the place of that drawn by horse power, and sooner or later
will itself give way to some fire extinguisher, the nature of
which time will disclose.</p>

<p>The Plymouth Fire Department, as now organized, is exceedingly
creditable to the town. It consists of a board of
five engineers and 130 men, with the following apparatus and
equipment:</p>

<p>In the two story brick central station in Main street, Steamer
H. P. Bailey No. 3, hose wagon, ladder truck, chemical
engine, hose reel, seven horses.</p>

<p>In the two story brick station on South street, Steamer No. 2,
the Jeremiah Farris, hose wagon, ladder truck, and five horses.</p>

<p>At the Seaside station, Steamer No. 1, reel and hose.</p>

<p>At Hall Town, reel and hose.</p>

<p>At Whiting street, reel and hose.</p>

<p>At Baptist street, reel and hose.</p>

<p>At the Langford house, Chiltonville reel and hose.</p>

<p>Two hundred and twenty-eight hydrants: four hand engines,
laid up; nine thousand feet of hose; twenty-five fire alarm signal
boxes, and a battery room in the Central station.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add that the appropriation for the
maintenance of the department for the present year is eleven
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Of funerals and their management, in early times, I have not
much to say. Most of the funeral customs of ancient days
had passed away before I was born. Funeral feasts and the
gifts of gloves and scarfs and rings, a serious tax on the
mourners, and a substantial profit to the officiating clergymen
and pall bearers, who received them, were no longer in vogue.
Until about the middle of the eighteenth century, prayers formed
no part of a funeral ceremony, and it is said that the first
prayer at a funeral in Boston was offered by Rev. Dr. Charles
Chauncey at the interment of Rev. Dr. Jonathan Mayhew, pastor
of the First Church, July 9, 1766. The sermon, which introduced
the custom, which prevailed later of preaching funeral
sermons, was preached by Dr. John Clarke in the Brattle street
meeting house at the interment of Rev. Dr. Samuel Cooper,
who died September 29, 1783. The rings given at funerals
were of black enamel, edged with gold, inscribed with the name,
age and date of the death of the deceased. The only one I
ever saw was found a few years ago in the garden of the
house which stood on the site of the Plymouth Savings Bank,
and given to me. Recognizing the initials on the ring, and the
date of death as those of one whose descendant at one time lived
in the house referred to, I gave it to one of the family. It is
said that Rev. Andrew Eliot, pastor of what was called the new
North Church in Boston, received twenty-nine hundred and
forty gloves at funerals, weddings and baptisms, a large number
of which he sold, receiving therefor a very considerable
addition to his salary. It was a custom which has not been
abolished many years, on the Sunday after the death of a relative,
to have a note read to the congregation asking prayers for
the loss of a parent or wife or husband or friend. I have heard
on some occasions as many as a dozen of these notes read before
the announcement of the text of the sermon. An amusing
story is told of a note, asking prayers for an inconsolable
husband for the loss of a beloved wife, being found in a pulpit
bible by a clergyman supplying the pulpit for the day only,
who supposing it a new one, read it to the congregation, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
had listened to it a year before, much to the consternation of
the inconsolable husband, who was present in the church with a
new bride. Though the custom of a funeral dinner, at which
the pall bearers were guests, which has been described as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Containing lots of fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like mourning coaches, when the funeral’s done,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>had disappeared, I remember when it was the invariable custom
for the pall bearers to return with the mourners to the house
of the deceased and indulge in such wine or liquor as best
suited their tastes. This custom continued until the temperance
agitation about 1833, and has never been resumed. Funeral
customs were different in different places, some inherited
from the Dutch, and some from the English. In New York
there were as in Massachusetts before the introduction of the
hearse, six bearers who relieved each other in carrying the coffin
on a bier to the grave, and six others who walked beside the
bier, each holding a tassel of the pall or funeral cloth. At
Mrs. Catalina de Peyster’s funeral, six young ladies attended
as pall bearers dressed in white sarcinet jackets and petticoats
with their heads uncovered, and their hair powdered and done
up with white ribbon. The first hearse was used in Boston in
1796, and the first in Plymouth was used at the funeral of
Thomas Pope, the father of the late Capt. Richard Pope, who
died July 6, 1820. The first funeral which I remember, was
that of Henry Warren, which I saw forming in front of his
late residence on the corner of North street, but the first one I
attended, was that of my great uncle, Samuel Davis, at Mrs.
Nicolson’s boarding house on Court Square, where he died July
10, 1829. I can point out the very spot where, holding my
mother’s hand, I listened to the passing bell, and waited impatiently
for the procession to start. I thought then that the
passing bell merely announced the march of the procession, and
did not realize that it was really the celebration of the passage
of a human soul through the gates of heaven.</p>

<p>The funeral hearse has a varied history, and in its present use
has been diverted from its original design and purpose. At
various early times the hearse and the catafalque were the same,
and neither was ever used as a vehicle. It was a temporary
structure set up in a chapel or house or place of burial, sometimes
constructed at great cost, where the body lay for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
in state. In Strype’s Memorials the funeral ceremonies of the
bishop of Winchester are described, after which, as he says, the
body “was put into a wagon with four horses all covered with
black.” Strype also describes the funeral of Henry the Eighth
at which “in the chapel was ordained a goodly formal hearse
with four score square tapers; every light containing two foot
in length poising in the whole eighteen hundred weight of wax
garnished about with pensils and escutcheons banners and bannerols
of descents, and at the four corners four banners of
saints beaten in fine gold upon damask.” He further says, that
“on the 14th of February the chariot was brought to the Court
hall door and the corpse with great reverence brought from the
hearse to the same.” These extracts show conclusively that
the hearse was a temporary structure erected in a chapel, or
elsewhere, and that since the abandonment of its use, its name
has been transferred to the vehicle carrying the body to the
grave.</p>

<p>In early chapters I have alluded to various habits and customs
prevailing during my boyhood, but have left untouched
many associated with every day life. A reference to these,
like charity, must begin at home, and as I recall my boyhood
days and everything associated with them, I realize,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How cruelly sweet are the echoes that start,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When memory plays an old tune on the heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How well I remember the room, in which the family spent
their evenings around the square centre table, lighted perhaps
by two brass lamps, or by what was called an astral lamp,
which was the first step in that series of illuminating
contrivances, which included afterwards first the solar
and then the carcel lamp, finally culminating in gas, which
was introduced into Plymouth in 1855. For special occasions
spermaceti candles were added, which were made at home in
candle moulds with spermaceti bought at the Plymouth oil factory.
Tallow candles and bayberry candles were used by
many less well to do people, and to them kerosene oil, which
came into use about the time of the introduction of gas at a
price lower than whale oil, was a welcome boon. In the material
world I know no greater civilizer than this oil has been
among our people. The houses of those in the smaller towns,
and in the suburbs of our own town, in which the sputtering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
oil lamp was extinguished at what was called early candle light,
sending the occupants to bed, now display a cheerful sitting
room, in which a centre table with books and magazines, and a
parlor organ, or perhaps a piano, afford means of education and
amusement, and promote a higher and a longer life. Some
years ago statistics showed that insanity was especially prevalent
among farmers with their days of constant and anxious
work, unrelieved by seasons of amusement and good cheer.
But kerosene oil has changed all this, and has lifted the curtain
which once shut out the light of a cheerful life, and has immeasurably
broadened the horizon within which farmers live.</p>

<p>What evenings those were at our home, the mother with her
children, unattracted by clubs and societies away from the
grand functions of a mother’s life; the children, out of the
street, supplementing the instruction of school with that which
only a parent could furnish. I know no greater change within
my lifetime than that exhibited by the lessening influence
of home. It has been brought about, partly by the disintegrating
effect of civilized life, which with new means of heating
and lighting, has scattered the members of a family, leaving no
fireside to gather around, and has drawn them for intellectual
and moral instructions beyond the limits of home; and partly, I
am sorry to say, by the inculcation in some quarters of the idea
that the management of a family and home is a drudgery, which
should be avoided in the search for what is called a higher life.
It seems useless to ask why the management of an institution
incorporated by the acts of God, than which nothing can be
nobler, is any more drudgery than the management of a railroad
or steamboat or factory, incorporated by the legislature of
the state. I halt, however, on the threshold of a subject too
broad for discussion here, and only alluded to because I believe
it to be one touching the best and truest life of society.</p>

<p>Until about 1832 no attempt was made to heat our houses
with any other fuel than wood. In nearly every room there
was a fireplace, that in the living room in some houses supplemented
by a Franklin or Pierpont stove, which stood on the
outer verge of the hearth, and with flaring sides, threw all the
heat into the room without the loss of any by escape into the
chimney. When coal was introduced, perhaps a grate was
set in the living room, and into some of the chambers a spitfire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
stove, and finally as the last step in methods of heating, came
the furnace. Fires in chambers were in my day far from being
universal. I do not think that at home I ever slept in a
heated chamber, except when sick, until I was sixteen years of
age. How well I remember lying in bed looking at the peacocks
and other figures on the chintz curtain of my four post
bedstead, dreading to get up and wash my face and hands with
water frozen in the pitcher. Warming pans, now obsolete,
were invaluable in those days. In making fires in the different
fireplaces, instead of using shavings or newspapers and matches,
a fire pan, a very important article in every house, was used
to carry a brand, or a parcel of coals from the kitchen fire,
which placed under the wood, with the aid of a bellows soon
kindled into a cheerful blaze. The fire pan made of iron, had a
wooden handle, a cover punched with holes, and its under side
sloped up in front. The kitchen fire, like the chanukkah light of
the Jews, which was intended to be perpetual, was supposed to
never go out, and being covered up at night, was rekindled in
the morning. If a neighbor lost his fire he would come to our
house with a fire pan and borrow a brand. In connection with
fires the foot stove must be mentioned, an article indispensable
in those times when houses were insufficiently heated. It was
also an indispensable article in the meeting house, where the
heat from a box stove, with a long funnel running overhead the
full length of the house, was supplemented by the foot stoves
in the pews to a degree, which alone made the atmosphere tolerable.
I recall the relief from the Sabbath imprisonment at
home in those days, when it seemed to me,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That congregations ne’er break up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Sabbaths never end.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>when I was permitted to go to the meeting house with the foot
stove and place it in the pew. The use of the foot stove in
church was almost as ancient as the New England meeting
house itself. On the fourth of March, 1744, it was voted by
the town “that each person leaving his or her stove in any of
the meeting houses in said town, after the people are all gone
out (but the sexton) shall forfeit and pay the sum of five shillings
to be improved as the law directs; and the stove so left
to be forfeited to the sexton finding the same, and the sexton
of each meeting house in the town is required carefully to inspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
the pews and seats in each meeting house he or they have
the care of, and to take into his possession all such stoves as
may be so left in either or any of said meeting houses, and them
keep in his possession until the owners thereof pay him the
value of said stove or stoves so taken; and also each sexton is
required and impowered to prosecute each person leaving his
or her stove as aforesaid, and to recover the penalty set on such
offender by this act.”</p>

<p>The kitchen in our house was almost a baronial hall, nearly
thirty feet long, with an open fireplace wide enough to take a
four foot stick for a forestick, and deep enough to take an iron
back log six inches square, bearing up a back stick with sticks
between making a roaring fire capable of performing the multiplicity
of duties assigned to it. On the left side was a fire
hole by which a wash boiler set in brick in the sink room was
heated. Over the fire was a long iron crane with its pot hooks
and tramells from which a teakettle always hung, never permitting
any usurpation of its place by pots and kettles of less royal
station. By its side hung the boiling kettle from whose recesses
came at times those wonders of culinery art, the hard boiled
puddings tied in a bag, of which the present generation knows
nothing, and with which nothing has ever been seen since to
furnish any comparison. They were the hard boiled rice, plum
rice, apple, Indian, Indian suet, batter, bread and huckleberry,
sure proofs to all who remember them that the world has retrograded.
The hasty pudding was exempted from confinement
in a bag, a pudding older than New England, and a favorite
food of the Indians. Joel Barlow described its preparation in
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“She learnt with stones to crack the well dried maize,</div>

<p>On the right hand side of the fireplace was a brick oven with
an opening into the ash pit in front of the door to receive the
coals and ashes when the oven was sufficiently heated. This
kind of oven is often called the “Dutch Oven,” but it lacks that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
distinctive feature of the Dutch oven, a door on the outside of
the house opening into a small lean-to under which the baking
was done. In front of the fireplace was the tin kitchen, in
which all the roasting was done, having a long spit running
through it to hold the meat or turkey, the basting being done
through a door on its back. The baking of bread, if not done
in the oven when it happened to be heated, was done either in
a creeper or in a tin Yankee baker before the fire. Inside the
jams hung the indispensable bellows, and the waffle irons,
which were often called into use. I supposed as others did,
that when waffle irons were first used they were a new discovery
in the culinary art. But bless you, my young admirers of
waffles, they were older than the country, and were brought
from Holland by the Dutch. The irons were called by the
Dutch “Izers.” In New York the waffles were called “Izer
cookies,” in New Jersey “split cakes,” and in Philadelphia
“squeeze cakes,” and finally became known as waffles, a name
which seems to have been an abbreviation of “wafers.” As
some of my readers may never have seen these irons, I will
describe them as two iron handles, joined and worked like a
pair of scissors, each having at its end a square or round plate
five or six inches in diameter, fitting into each other and holding
the dough, which is pressed, receiving the design cast in
the inside of the plates. There is an old song remembered
by Dutch descendants partly Dutch and partly English, which
in its allusion to waffles shows the antiquity of the cakes, and
which I submit to our high school scholars for translation:</p>

<p>There are other articles of food which have come from the
Dutch. The cooky from the Dutch word kockje, the cruller
from the Dutch kruller, and noodles for soup from the Dutch
noodlegees are well known. Our doughnut called in England
in old times donnuts, are the same as the old Dutch oly-coecks,
which originally had a raisin embedded in their centre.</p>

<p>In describing the old kitchen, I must not forget the coffee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
grinder, which hung on the wall, in which our grandmothers
knew enough not to grind more than sufficient for a day’s use.
Coffee was coffee in those days, and not the mixture of chicory
and pease now imposed on those who buy what is called ground
coffee. I say to my readers, pay no attention to the advertisers
of postum and other substitutes for coffee, who magnify
the ill effects of the genuine article. Always buy your
coffee in the bean, roast and grind it yourself, and preserve
its full flavor in an air tight box until used. I know that in
Paris sixty years ago, coffee roasters were to be seen every
morning along the sidewalks or in the court yards of the houses,
showing the general importance attached to the morning
beverage, and that everywhere in hotel and restaurant delicious
coffee was always served. In 1895 no such scenes on the sidewalks
came under my observation, and poor coffee had become
the rule. No doubt the change is due to the use of ground
coffee, which has either lost its flavour, or is an adulterated
article.</p>

<p>In the autumn in my youth there was a solicitude concerning
the articles to be laid in for the winter. First good potatoes
must be found, twenty bushels of which with a barrel
of sweet German turnips, and a bushel of carrots and onions
must be put in brick bins in the cellar, where exposed to as
little light as possible, they would in the days before furnaces
keep well till spring. Then in a cool part of the cellar, places
must be found for five barrels of apples, one each of Rhode
Island Greenings, Baldwins, Russets, Holmes apples and sweet
apples. Of course a firkin of good butter must be laid in, a
jar of tamarinds, a jar of malaga grapes, and fifty pounds of
well selected codfish, the last to be broad and thick, and not
more than eighteen inches long including the tail. The fish
must be kept in a close box, and placed in the garret. Never
buy stripped codfish, for if you do you will probably get hake,
polluck, skate and catfish, and other cheap denisons of the
sea. In speaking of articles of food, in which
there have been changes, there are other articles besides coffee
and codfish not altogether creditable to those who provide them
for public use. The sweet oil that you buy may be lard or cotton
seed, the horseradish, which you wish for your veal in the
spring, is largely flat turnip; some of the canned tomatoes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
green and colored red, and much of your vinegar and whiskey
is manufactured. The Philadelphia capons, Rhode Island
turkeys and Vermont geese displayed on your hotel menus
were raised in Plympton, Carver and Halifax. Our traders are
honest, but they sell what they buy without analysis, leaving
their protection to the law. Many of these misrepresentations
are innocent enough, and cannot be classed with that which
daily stares us in the face on the first page of a newspaper
which is delivered at the hotels and newstands at half past
twelve and dated 4.05. The worst feature of such misrepresentations
as this is that it teaches the newsboys to make the
false claim after 4.05, that the paper so dated is the last edition.
One of the occasional domestic functions of our home was a
quilting bee, in which friends and neighbors joined for the
purpose of quilting a counterpane or bed quilt, made of patchwork.
We had a set of quilting bars, four strips of wood
about eight feet long, with holes a few inches apart, which
when resting on the tops of chairs, could be put together by
means of pegs at the corners, and enlarged as the quilt required
more space between the side bars. As there were not
many of these bars in town ours were constantly in demand, and
loaned from one to another. I suppose these patchwork quilts
are still in use, but the last one I ever saw was given to me by
Mrs. Taylor, a daughter of Uncle Branch Pierce, in acknowledgment
of service rendered her in securing the return of the
body of her son, David A. Taylor, who was killed during the
civil war. A part of my occupation at school in early boyhood
was sewing patchwork squares together, to be used in
quilts when needed.</p>

<p>Invariably on Saturday night my brother and I were given
the weekly bath, which was not especially welcome in winter,
but as cleanliness was next to Godliness, it was esteemed a
proper preparation for Sunday. A countryman visiting New
York for the first time must have been accustomed to the same
habit, for he wrote home to his wife that “agin my room in the
hotel is another room, with a bath tub and hot and cold water,
and a lot of towels, and when I see them things I almost
wished, begosh, that it was Saturday night.” Notwithstanding
the bath tub preparation for the Sabbath, I am sorry to say
that the hours of that day were those of my youth which I recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
with the least pleasure. A strict observance of the Sabbath
was the custom of the time, and the day was devoted until
late in the afternoon to Scripture reading and Sunday-school
lessons in the morning, and attendance twice at church, with
Sunday-school at noon. Parents in those days did not permit
their children to loiter at home and on the street until the morning
service was finished, and then send them to Sunday-school,
for they believed that the religious and moral instruction received
from the pulpit was as important as that received
through catechisms from teachers in the pew.</p>

<p>After the second service my brother and I were sometimes
permitted to take hold of hands and make a call at the house of
my uncle Mr. Nathaniel Morton Davis, or at the house of my
great aunt, Hannah White, then ninety years of age, a descendant
of Peregrine White, who had talked with those who well
knew the first born son of New England. Occasionally, also,
I went with my mother to visit Miss Molly Jackson, an aunt
of my grandmother Davis, who at the age of nearly one hundred
occupied a second story room in the southwest
corner of the house in Hobbs Hole, next south of that of Thos.
E. Cornish. My visits to her connected me with an earlier
date than any other incidents in my life, giving me an opportunity
to see and talk with a person born one hundred and
seventy-six years ago, or only twenty-five years after the death
of Peregrine White. The lax observance of the Sabbath now
prevailing in marked contrast with its observance in earlier
times, believing as I do in the beneficent and conservative influence
of stated days of rest for man and beast, aside from
all religious considerations, should be considerately and wisely
reformed.</p>

<p>Besides the quilting bee which has been mentioned, there
were formerly many other kinds of bees, some within my own
time, and others that I have heard about from my elders. There
were the chopping and stone bees, by which a new comer in a
settlement was assisted by all his neighbors in clearing the
land for his house and farm; the apple gathering bee and the
woodpile bee, in which under the full moon the fiddle and the
dance played an important part. There was also the raising
bee, when a house completely framed was ready to be set up,
in which all the carpenters joined and found under the stimulating
influence of Medford rum that in lifting plates and studs
and rafters their yoke was easy, and their burden light. In
raising the house on the upper westerly corner of High and
Spring streets in 1799, the frame fell, precipitating from thirty
to forty carpenters to the ground, twenty-one of whom were
seriously, though none fatally injured. In that case the rum
proved to be a little above proof, and the treenail fastenings a
little below. The last house in Plymouth raised with the Medford
accompaniment, was that now standing on the southerly
corner of Howland street, built in 1834. The great bee, which
was celebrated all over the corn growing parts of our country
in olden times, was the husking bee, not the sham frolic of
present days when, like the fox bought in a bag by Newport
hunters, a load of corn on the stalk is bought for the occasion
and piled on a floor glistening under electric lights, but the
genuine husking frolic in a barn of ample proportions, where
piles of pumpkins furnished the decorations, and cornstalk
fiddles enlivened the scene. There the lads and lassies sat
around the diminishing heap, and all knew the dangers and
delights which attended the finding of a red or a smutty ear
of corn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“In the barn the youths and maidens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strip the corn of husk and tassel,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The literature of the husking bee is extensive, and there
are mysterious legends of ancient date about the red ear of
corn. As early as the year 1700, in the ceremony of marriage
among the Caughnawaga Indians, the husband gave the wife
a deer’s leg, and the wife gave the husband a red ear, and in
Hiawatha, Longfellow speaks of the husking as if it were a
usage among the Indians.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“When’er some lucky maiden</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mushka; you shall have a sweetheart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You shall have a handsome husband.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>John Barlow in his hasty pudding poem written in 1792
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The laws of husking every wight can tell—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sure no laws he ever keeps so well;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For each red ear a general kiss he gains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She walks the round, and culls one favored beau,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who leaps the luscious tribute to bestow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “traits of American humor” a writer said, “there was a
corn husking, and I went along with Sol. Stebbins. There
was all the gals and boys setting around and I got sot down
so near Sal Babit that I’ll be darned if I didn’t kiss her before
I knowed what I was about.” In the South the corn husk
was called a shuck, and President Lincoln showed his familiarity
with southern terms, when, after his conference at Fortress
Monroe with Alexander H. Stephens, the vice president of the
Confederacy, who was a very small man, weighing not more
than ninety or a hundred pounds, and on that occasion wore
an immense borrowed overcoat, which came down to his heels,
he described Mr. Stevens as the smallest ear in the largest
shuck he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Husking time among the negroes of North Carolina was
always a season of relaxation and frolic. The following now
no longer heard was among the husking songs they sang.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh boys! Come along and shuck the corn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh boys! Come along to the rattle of the horn!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll shuck and sing to the coming of the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And den we’ll ford the river.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh Bob Ridley, O! O! O!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How could you fool the possum so!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that at one time the harvest husking
festival degenerated into noisy scenes, which called for
earnest condemnation and earnest appeals for reform. Cotton
Mather wrote in 1713 that “the riots that have too often accustomed
our huskings, have carried in them fearful ingratitude
and provocation unto the glorious God.” But all through my
boyhood pumpkin pie and sweet cider alone remained as relics
of the ancient feast.</p>

<p>Christmas during my day came and went without observance
or notice. It was not a holiday, presents were not exchanged,
schools were kept, and the wish for a “Merry Christmas”
was never heard. Puritan soil was not a favorable one
for its observance. In 1659 any observance of Christmas
“either by forbearing of labor, feasting, or any other way”
was forbidden under a penalty of five shillings for each offence.
Though this law was repealed in 1681 the leaders of the Massachusetts
Colony, including Judge Samuel Sewall, still looked
on Christmas revels as offensive to the Holy Son of God. During
my boyhood the St. Andrews church in Scituate, which
was later removed to Hanover, where it is now a flourishing
church, was the only Episcopal church in Plymouth county.
It is singular that in its early years it derived its membership
and support from the Winslows and the Whites, descendants
of Mayflower Pilgrims. As far as I can learn nearly all bearing
those names in Marshfield and Scituate, among whom I
include my own kinsmen, were Episcopalians, and some of
those residing in Plymouth, were members of St. Andrew’s
church. The records of the Plymouth First Church contain
a petition of my great aunt, Joanna Winslow, and her daughter,
Mrs. Henry Warren, to be admitted to the Plymouth fold,
on account of the distance of St. Andrew’s from their homes
in Plymouth. It is an anomaly difficult to understand that so
many of Pilgrim blood should have returned to the faith from
which their ancestors were glad to separate. With regard to
Christmas I am inclined to think that its observance has found
its way through its appeal to the æsthetic rather than the
religious sense of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span></p>

<p>Of the many cults and isms and doctrines, which have appeared
within my recollection, I do not propose to speak. In
the Bibliographia Antiquariana may be found, I think, nearly
a hundred of their names terminating in “mancy,” which at
various times have found lodgment in the minds of men. Some
of these still have their followers, and I am willing to accord
to them as sound reasons for their faith as I claim for my own.
The only limit to my tolerance is that set by the followers themselves
in the contradictory acts of their every day life. Not
long ago in a casual conversation with a devotee of an ism,
the name of which I do not know, I incidentally said, “it is
a stormy day, Madam,” to which she answered, “It seems so,
but it isn’t.” To my inquiry, “Why, then, do you carry an umbrella,”
she made no reply, and I bade her good morning.</p>

<p>In my early boyhood the primitive methods of kindling a
fire were only a little in advance of the method of rubbing
two sticks together, practised by the Indians. Until 1829, so
far as my own observation went, the tinder box, with the flint
and steel, was in use. Some used what was called the chemical
match, a stick dipped first in sulphur, and then into a composition
of chlorate of potash, and other ingredients, which
dipped in a vial of sulphuric acid produced fire as the result of
chemical action between the acid and potash. In 1829 it was
found that sticks coated with chlorate of potash and phosphorus
could be instantly ignited by rubbing them on sandpaper.
This was the first step leading to the manufacture
of the lucifer match, now in almost universal use. The lucifer
match was at first called locofoco, a name derived from the
Latin “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loco foci</i>,” meaning “In the place of fire.” The name
loco foco applied to the democratic party had its origin in 1835
in the incident of relighting by means of matches the burners
in a hall in New York, where a democratic meeting was held,
and the light had been extinguished by party opponents. In
recent years safety matches have been extensively used, the
best of which are made in Sweden, which can be ignited only
on the boxes in which they are sold. With the frequency of
fires occasioned by the lucifer match, it is a wonder to me
that either by law or by rules of insurance companies, some
restriction is not put on its use. It is estimated that more
than six million gross of lucifer matches, with 14,400 to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
gross, are annually consumed in the United States. A story
was told me by the late Rev. Dr. George E. Ellis, about John
Quincy Adams who died in 1848, nineteen years after the lucifer
match came into use. Dr. Ellis attended with Mr. Adams
about 1840 an historical meeting in New York, and occupied
with him a double bedded room at the Astor House. In
those days only a few rooms in hotels were ever heated, and
those by means of a coal grate, which was kept full of kindlings
and coal ready to be lighted by matches, of which there was
always a supply on the mantel. When Mr. Adams got into
bed, though the fire had not been lighted, he opened a window
much to the discomfort of Mr. Ellis, who planned to close it
when his room-mate fell asleep. But Mr. Adams talked for an
hour, and then said, “I am going to repeat aloud the prayer
which I have said every night since I was nine years old, and
then turn over and go to sleep.” He then said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now I lay me down to sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray the Lord my soul to keep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I should die before I wake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray the Lord my soul to take.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Amen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After he was safely asleep, Dr. Ellis arose quietly and shut
the window. He was awakened in the morning by some noise,
and looking over his bedclothes, he saw Mr. Adams on his
knees by the side of his open valise, from which he had taken
his tinder box, and was getting a spark to touch off the kindlings
in the grate. He scorned the use of the matches on the
mantel, preferring the friends of his youth and age, which
had been his faithful attendants through life.</p>

<p>There were few articles in domestic use in my youth more
popular than the apple, and few performing such a variety of
parts in the performances of the kitchen. A New England
supper would have been incomplete without an apple pie. The
English sneer at our corn, saying it is only fit for horses, while
they worship their oats, which are more fit for the horse trough
than the table. So, while they condemn our apple pie, made
with a crust thoroughly baked, they gorge themselves in July
and August and September with gooseberry and green gage
tarts, which no armored war ship could resist if fired from a
Whitworth gun at the distance of a mile. Behold the products
of the apple, a roasted apple, a Marlboro pudding, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
like an ordinary pie without crust, a pan-dowdy, or apple
grunt baked with molasses in a deep pan, and the crust broken
in, pork and apples cut up together and cooked, called
by the Dutch “speck and apple jees,” plain apple sauce, apple
butter or Vermont apple sauce boiled with cider and put up
for winter, apple brandy warranted to kill at thirty paces,
called in New Jersey “Jersey lightning,” and apple pudding.
To the apple then, notwithstanding John Bull, let the toast go
round.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the history of man no article in common use
has undergone greater changes than that used in writing, and
many of those changes have occurred within my memory.
The stylus of the ancients used on waxen tablets, has become
a factor in the advance of civilization, until it may now be said
that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beneath the rule of men entirely great,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pen is mightier than the sword.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The stylus on waxen tablets gave way to reeds used with a
fluid on papyrus, and reeds to quills of swans and geese and
crows. For a long time geese were raised chiefly for their
quills, and it is said that in one year twenty-seven millions
of these quills were sent to England from St. Petersburg. Until
the steel pen was introduced in my later youth, the goose quill
held undivided sway in the United States, and for some years
afterwards the price of the steel pen was not sufficiently reduced
to admit of its popular use. In all the schools which I
ever attended the teachers spent a large portion of their time in
mending pens, an occupation so constant and universal as to
introduce into our vocabulary the name “pen knife,” which
still holds its place, though the use for which it was designed
has departed. As late as 1858 and 1859, when I was in the
senate, among the articles of stationery distributed among the
members, were a bunch of quills and a pen knife. As John
Quincy Adams once wrote in a lady’s album:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In days of yore the poet’s pen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From wing of bird was plundered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps of goose, but now and then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Jove’s own eagle sundered.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the successive steps taken in the manufacture of pens
until the steel pen, the gold pea with diamond point, and at
last the fountain pen came into use, which was followed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
typewriting machine I do not propose to speak. In business
the machine seems to be coming rapidly into use, and is even
finding its way into social correspondence. I have an old
man’s notion, which if I live I may outgrow, that only with the
hand should a letter of friendship be written. By the use
of the typewriter I fear that the accomplishment of letter writing
has become a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The marriage laws of Massachusetts prevailing today are
different from those in force all through my youth. As early
as 1786 a law was passed by the General Court of Massachusetts
establishing the methods to be pursued by those intending
to enter into marriage, which provided that all persons
intending to be joined in marriage, should “cause notice of
their intention to be filed with the town clerk fourteen days
before their marriage, which notice should be published by the
clerk, either by posting up a written notice in some public place
in the town of which he is clerk, fourteen days at least before
the marriage or by making public proclamation thereof at
three public religious meetings in the town on separate days,
not less than three days distant from each other, exclusive of
the days of publication.” This law with slight amendments
remained in force until 1850, when the present law was enacted
requiring only a notice to the town clerk, by whom the necessary
certificate would be issued. I remember well the little
box with a glass front attached to the wall in the vestibule
of the meeting house in which the marriage intention was
posted, and I have often heard it read from the pulpit on the
three Sundays required by law, much to the embarrassment
of the loving pair sitting within the gaze of the congregation.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable developments within my memory
has been the number of articles claimed to be associated
with the Mayflower and the Pilgrims. Not a month passes
without the reception at Pilgrim Hall of a letter offering for
sale a Mayflower relic. It may be a tea pot, though the Pilgrims
had no tea; or a porcelain mug, though the inventories
recorded in Plymouth contained no porcelain ware until 1660;
or a fork, which the Pilgrims did not use, or a mahogany
table, though no mahogany was known in England before
1700.</p>

<p>Three articles claimed to have been associated with the Pilgrims
I have myself proved to bear fictitious labels. One of
these exhibited a few years ago at a portrait exhibition in Copley
Square as a miniature of Governor Edward Winslow, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
he was six years of age, I have found to be a picture of a son of
Capt. Thomas Dingley of Marshfield, painted about the time
of the Revolution. Another article labelled the “Knocker”
from the door of Governor Winslow’s house, was taken from
the door of a house built by Isaac Winslow, grandson of the
governor, about 1720. Still another article presented to the
Pilgrim Society as a part of the doorstep of a church in Delfthaven
where the Pilgrims held service on the eve of their departure,
owed the origin of its record to a miss-reported
speech of one of the building committee of a church in Chicago,
who had at its dedication stated that he had imbedded
in its walls a piece of Plymouth Rock, a stone from Scrooby,
and a piece of the pavement of a church in Delfthaven, which,
perhaps, the Pilgrims may have visited. Of course the piece
of doorstep has never found a lodgment in Pilgrim Hall.
These fictitious historic relics are interesting as showing the
veneration in which the Pilgrims are held, which is not shared
by the Winthrop Colony, or by any other body of men since the
days of Christ.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by my readers that at the dinner of
the Old Colony Club on the 22d of December, 1769, the first
course was “a large baked Indian Whortleberry pudding.”
I have often been asked how long the custom continued of
serving the pudding before the meat, and whether I remembered
such a custom, and my reply has been that the only relic
of the custom existing within my day was a legend of the promise
once made at dinner to children, that the more pudding they
ate the more meat they might have. I always supposed that
this promise was intended to restrict indulgence in meat, either
from motives of economy, or to confine the youthful diet to
a more wholesome food. I have recently read an extract from
a book of travels written by Henry Bradshaw Fearon, an
Englishman, who visited the United States in 1817. The book
is in the Congressional Library in Washington, and probably
never had a circulation on this side of the ocean. It contains
much of interest to an American reader, including an approximately
accurate answer to the question concerning the custom
above mentioned. Mr. Fearon left New York on the 8th of
September, 1817, on the steamboat Connecticut, bound for
New Haven, and he described the boat as having an engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
of forty horse power, and fitted up with one cabin for ladies,
two for gentlemen, and an extensive kitchen. Arriving at
New Haven in twelve hours, he was transferred to the steamboat
Fulton, bound to New London, from which place he took
a stage via Providence for Boston. The fare from New
York to New Haven, including table board, was seven dollars.
On a Sunday, while in Boston, he went to Quincy and dined
with ex-president John Adams. The dinner was served at
one o’clock, and consisted of a first course of Indian meal
pudding and molasses, and a second course of veal, bacon,
neck of mutton, cabbage, carrots, and Indian beans, with Madeira
wine. He said that Boston was the headquarters of
Federalism in politics and Unitarianism in religion, and that
the Bostonians were the most intelligent and hospitable people
he had met in America. Thus it is certain that the pudding
custom was in vogue in 1817, and was discontinued not long
afterwards.</p>

<p>The allusion above made to the steamboats Connecticut and
Fulton, leads me to again refer to the steamboat Eagle, which
came to Plymouth in 1818 under the command of Capt. Lemuel
Clark. That boat was built in New York, but like other
boats was enjoined under a New York law from operating
in New York waters, on the ground of a monopoly in the use of
the rivers and harbors of New York, which had been granted
by the state. Resistance to this monopoly led to the famous
case of Gibbons against Ogden, in which, while the monopoly
was held good by the state courts, it was decided by the Supreme
Court of the United States to be unconstitutional.
Pending the decision in that case, steamboats sought business
in other waters, and the Eagle, before coming to Boston and
Plymouth, cruised in Chesapeake bay, under the command of
Capt. Moses Rogers, who was in 1819 commander of the
steamship Savannah, which in that year was the first steamship
to cross the Atlantic. A picture of the Eagle is owned
by the Pilgrim Society. Capt. Rogers was the grandfather
of our townsman, Dr. Charles Rufus Rogers, and it is the
story of the Savannah, which leads me into a digression which
may make necessary an additional chapter of memories which
I had intended to close with the next chapter. A memoir of
Capt. Moses Rogers states that the Savannah was a full rigged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
ship of three hundred and fifty tons, built at Corlear’s Hook,
New York, by Francis Fickett, and launched August 22, 1818.
She was bought by Scarborough and Isaacs of Savannah,
and her machinery, with a ninety horse power engine, having
forty-inch cylinders, and a five foot stroke, was put in under
the supervision of Capt. Rogers. Besides the Eagle he had
already commanded the steamboat Fulton on the Hudson river,
and the Phenix on the Delaware river. A picture of the Savannah,
a copy of which I have seen, represents her as a vessel
of fine model, with round stern, a medium clipper bow, and
a graceful, easy shear. Her wheels were made adjustable, and
so affixed to the shaft as in stormy weather to be unshipped and
removed to the deck in twenty minutes. Her wheels consisted
of eight radial arms held in place by one flange,
and arranged to close like a fan. With her allowance of
seventy-five tons of coal and twenty-five cords of wood, she
sailed from New York, March 28, 1819, and arrived at Savannah
April 6, in two hundred and seven hours from Sandy
Hook lightship, having steamed four days during the passage.
On the 22d of May she began her voyage from Savannah to
Liverpool, where she arrived on the 20th of June. Her log
kept by Stevens Rogers, the sailing master, a brother-in-law
of Capt. Moses Rogers, is in the possession of the descendants
of Moses, and contains an interesting account of
the voyage. On the 23d of July the Savannah set sail from
Liverpool for Cronstadt, touching at Copenhagen and Stockholm
on the way, reaching the first named port on the 9th of
September. A few days later she arrived at St. Petersburg,
where she remained until October 10, receiving while there
visits from the Russian Lord High Admiral Marcus de Travys.
On the 30th of November she again reached Savannah, and
was run as a packet between that port and New York, until
she was wrecked on Long Island.</p>

<p>Questions are often asked in newspapers and elsewhere concerning
the circumstances attending the composition of popular
hymns and songs, and I have already told my readers about
the origin of “Sweet Home,” and the “Star Spangled Banner.”
I have lately read in the Boston Sunday <cite>Herald</cite> an account
of the composition of “My Country ’tis of Thee,” by Samuel
Francis Smith, which may be interesting to those of my readers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
who did not happen to see it. Mr. Smith was born in
Sheafe street, Boston, October 21, 1808, and after attending
the Eliot school and the Boston Latin school, graduated at
Harvard in 1829. After graduating at the Andover Theological
Seminary in 1832, he was settled as pastor of the Baptist
church in Waterville, Me., and served as Professor of
Modern languages in Colby University until he removed to
Newton, Mass., where he resided until his death. At a meeting
in the Old South Church in Boston, Mr. Smith said, in
giving a history of the hymn, that many years before Mr. W.
C. Woodbridge brought from Germany a number of books containing
words and music used in the schools there, and gave
them to Mr. Lowell Mason, who gave them to him, requesting
him to either translate them or write words to such of
the music as pleased him. In looking these books over, Mr.
Smith found the notes of our National anthem attached to a
patriotic hymn, and was inspired by it to write the hymn in
question. To the tune of “God Save the King,” Mr. Smith’s
hymn was sung for the first time at a Sunday-school celebration
on the Fourth of July, 1832, and received at once such
popular commendation as to re-christen the tune with the name
of “America.” We, of course, ought to accept Mr. Smith’s
word, but it seems almost increditable that he should have
never heard of the tune until 1832, when it had been known
in England as “God Save the King” at least two hundred
years. It is also singular that the origin of many national
airs should be involved in doubt. The Marseillaise, Yankee
Doodle, and to a certain extent the “God Save the King” had
an obscure, if not doubtful, authorship. The last, however,
which has by some been attributed to Henry Carey, a musical
composer who flourished in the time of James the First, seems
to have been established by good evidence, to have been composed
by John Bull, a contemporary with Carey, who died in
1622. As I have not been able to trace the name John Bull
as applied to the English people, farther back than about the
early part of the 17th century, I think it is a reasonable conjecture
that Dr. Bull was not only the author of the National
anthem, but also through his authorship of that popular air that
he gave the name for all time to his fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>The composition of the favorite Pilgrim hymn “Sons of Renowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
Sires” by Judge John Davis of Boston in 1794, is interesting.
Coming to Plymouth on the evening of the 21st
of December to attend a celebration of the anniversary of the
Landing on the next day, the regret was expressed to him that
no original hymn had been prepared for the occasion, as had
been intended. He expressed no intention to write one, but
at an early hour retired to his chamber with his wife. Instead
of going to bed he began to walk the room to the annoyance
of his wife, and against her earnest remonstrances. Mrs.
Davis fell asleep, waking occasionally, and finding him still
walking, and the bed candle unsnuffed and smoking. Not
having the remotest idea what he was doing, she became alarmed
for his sanity, and again and again her sleep was broken
by the noise of his footsteps. At last the candle was extinguished,
and in the morning Mr. Davis surprised the committee
with the hymn, which was sung that day to the tune of
“God Save the King,” thirty-eight years before Mr. Smith,
the author of his anthem, had ever heard of it, and which has
been sung probably at every Pilgrim celebration since.</p>

<p>The story of the inspiration of “The Breaking Waves Dashed
High,” written by Mrs. Hemans, is also an interesting one.
In 1825 she was living with her brother at Rhyllon, a parish
of St. Asaph at the mouth of the river Clwyd in North Wales.
After shopping one day, one of her purchases was sent home
in a bandbox covered with a newspaper, which she noticed
was a Boston daily. Before throwing the paper away or burning
it, she had the curiosity to look over its contents in which
she found a long account of the Pilgrim celebration in Plymouth
on December 22, 1824, and copious extracts from the oration
delivered by Edward Everett. The Pilgrim story was a
new one to her, and the account, which she read with great
interest, was so circumstantial as to inspire her with the grandeur
of the theme. She told Rev. Charles T. Brooks on a visit
to her later home in Dublin, that she at once, after reading the
account, turned to her desk and wrote the immortal lines. The
original manuscript of the hymn she gave to James T. Fields
of Boston, and it is now preserved in the cabinet of the Pilgrim
Society, a gift from Mr. Fields.</p>

<p>It is singular how many of our best hymns have been the
work of an hour. It has been said that the missionary hymn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
by Reginald Heber, was one of those sudden inspirations. It
was written in 1819, while he was occupying a living in Hodnet
in Shropshire, which had been given to him by his brother
Richard, who was a member of parliament, and an owner of
large estates in that shire. In 1823 he was consecrated Bishop
of Calcutta, and died in India in 1826. Before going to India
he devoted himself to literary pursuits, and wrote many hymns,
which won a permanent place in hymnology, among which
was that sweetly flowing hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“By cool Saloam’s shady rill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How sweet the lily grows.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have heard it said that on one occasion Mr. Heber was
invited by a brother clergyman in a neighboring parish to officiate
at a missionary service to be held in his church. In the
course of the evening, before the day of the service, his friend
asked him if it would be possible for him to compose a hymn
appropriate to the occasion. Mr. Heber said he would try, and
retiring to another room, composed the hymn which for appropriateness
and beauty, has rarely been equalled. His brother
Richard was an author of note, and left at his death perhaps
the largest private library ever collected in England. It contained
146,875 volumes, and after his death, the library was
sold at an auction which continued through two hundred and
sixteen days, and realized sixty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Some years ago I heard the story of an incident which suggested
“The Hanging of the Crane,” one of the most charming
poems of Longfellow. In the early married life of Aldrich,
the poet, Longfellow dropped into his house one night and
found him and his wife sitting alone at their evening meal.
“Ah,” said he, as he entered the supper room and took a seat
at the table, “here Aldrich, is a whole poem, and I will give you
the subject to work out.” His friend, believing that the artist
who paints a scene in his imagination, should put it on the
canvas, said, “No, Longfellow, use it yourself.” After some
years of elaboration the poem appeared, depicting the changing
scenes in married life, which the following selected extracts
sufficiently describe. Happy are the father and mother who
live to witness the scenes which time discloses as it unrolls the
canvas:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The impromptu remark of Mr. Longfellow to Aldrich might
have been like many other impromptus thought out before. If
so, however, it was under authority of a poet’s license. Perhaps
it was like another of Mr. Longfellow’s impromptus, of
which I heard many years ago. While attending as a delegate
the National Republican Convention in Cincinnati in 1876, a
party composed of James Russell Lowell, Judge E. R. Hoar,
Mr. Roosevelt, the father of the President, who were also delegates,
and myself, took a carriage and drove out to the estate
of Nicholas Longworth to call on him and see his wine vaults.
Mr. Longworth told us that Mr. Longfellow had made a recent
call on him, and when introduced had said: “Mr. Longworth,
you have the advantage of me, for you know Pope says, “That
worth makes the man, and the want of it the fellow.” Some
men would have thought of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> the next day, and
realized what the French call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’esprit d’escallier</i>, a good thing
thought of too late. But Mr. Longfellow was quick witted
enough to think of the good thing “while going up stairs and
not while going down.” There have been severe critics of
Longfellow who would not have hesitated to pronounce the
above impromptu deliberately prepared. They have charged
him with plagiarism, and have said that the “Psalm of Life”
is composed of thoughts from Gœthe and Calderon and Schiller,
and have declared that “there is not one striking image, and
barely one striking phrase in the poem which originated absolutely
with himself.” They also claim that from Soame
Jennyn’s was taken the substance of those beautiful lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Still like muffled drums are beating</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Funeral marches to the grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span></p>
<p>But these critics cannot deny that the dress in which the
above thoughts were clothed, and in which they captivate the
reader, were his own. Would any one on the following statement
of facts claim that Webster was a plagiarist? Rev. Dr.
John Pierpont wrote for the Plymouth celebration on the 22d
of December, 1824, a hymn containing the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Pilgrim Fathers are at rest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Summer’s throned on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the world’s warm breast is in verdure dressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go stand on the hill where they lie.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The earliest ray of the golden day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On that hallowed spot is cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the evening sun as he leaves the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks kindly on that spot last.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the 17th of June, 1825, Mr. Webster delivered his memorable
oration at the laying of the cornerstone of Bunker Hill
monument, containing the well known passage, “Let it rise
till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest light of the
morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its summit.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXXVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>During my boyhood there was an article which had been for
many years in the cookery department of our house, but which
had recently gone out of use. It was called a roasting Jack,
and preceded the tin kitchen in roasting meats and poultry. I
remember it well, but I have little doubt that like many another
relic of the past, it found its way into the junk heap of William
Nye on the approach of some muster or election day, when we
boys wanted money for lobsters and lemonade and other promoters
of a stomachache which, perhaps, in these days of fads
would have been called appendicitis. It was an iron cylinder
about four inches in diameter and six inches long, attached at
the top with an intermediate swivel to the chimney crane, and
at the bottom to a hook or some other contrivance which held
the meat. Inside of the cylinder there was a clock work machinery,
which when wound up would keep the hook constantly
turning before the fire. It probably went out of use between
1800 and 1820.</p>

<p>There was another kind of roasting Jack, consisting of a spit
resting on hooks attached to the andirons to which a wheel was
affixed, which was kept turning by a chain band running from
a larger wheel moved by clock work attached to the under side
of the mantel piece. I have no doubt that many of my
readers have seen the hooks on old andirons without knowing
the purpose for which they were intended. These hooks may
be seen on a pair of andirons in the Pilgrim Hall Library.</p>

<p>There was another article closely associated with my childhood,
which I have thus far omitted to mention. How often
have I sat in a high chair with a bib under my chin, and a pap
spoon in hand, feeding myself out of a porringer. I supposed
that the porringer was the sole prerogative of children; that it
was designed expressly for their use, but I had not then learned
the fictions of legendary lore, and that the world is all a fleeting
show for a child’s illusion given. I learned the true origin
and use of the porringer some years ago. A lady wrote to
me that an elderly lady in Roxbury in somewhat reduced circumstances
owned a china soup tureen which was once used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
in the household of Queen Anne, and would be glad to sell it.
I went to see it, and found a very handsome tureen, but I saw
at once on its cover a knob representing a rabbit’s ear, the exclusive
mark of Wedgewood, who flourished during the time
of Queen Charlotte, and made a very beautiful cream colored
ware, of which this tureen was a specimen, and in honor of
Queen Charlotte called it “queen’s ware.” The story accompanying
the tureen was that an ancestor of its present owner
was at one time attached to Queen Anne’s Court, as one of the
ladies in waiting, and afterwards becoming reduced, emigrated
to New Brunswick, carrying with her the tureen, which
she received as a present during her service in the household
of the Queen. It is easy to account for the legend of its origin
by the supposition of some later owner, knowing it was
called queen’s ware, that it was a part of the ware of the
queen of whose household an ancestor was a member. Not
being satisfied with the result of my examination I began a
further investigation of the origin of soup tureens as articles
of table ware, and found that in the reign of Queen Anne, they
were neither used or known. The custom was to have soup
brought to the table by the servants in porringers, one of which
was placed before each guest. This was the design and purpose
of the porringer, and this was its use until the appearance
of the tureen about the middle of the eighteenth century, when
it was relegated to the use of children. In my day the porringer
was made of either silver or pewter, but as the fashion
of its use has gradually gone out the silver porringer has found
its way to the melting pot, and the pewter one to the bric-a-brac
store.</p>

<p>There are doubtless many genuine relics of the Queen Anne
period in existence. I have a hammered brass wine cooler of
that period, which came down in my mother’s family from
John White, son of Peregrine White, born in Marshfield about
1660. It is about the size and shape of an ordinary soup tureen,
with solid brass handles and slots around its edge, in
which wine glasses were hung with their bowls in the water.
It was called a “Monteth,” and took its name from the inventor.
The poet William King, who was born in 1663, and died
in 1712, alluded to the article in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“New names produce new words, and thus Monteth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has by a vessel saved his name from death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span></p>
<p>Among the books which I have examined with reference to
the articles above mentioned, is a very interesting one entitled
“Social life in the reign of Queen Anne,” to which I refer the
student of habits and customs in the early part of the 18th century.</p>

<p>In the flowers and fruits and trees of Plymouth the changes
in my day have not been striking. The garden flora are the
same as in my youth, except that new flowers have been introduced,
and new and improved varieties of the old ones. Fashion
has occasionally relegated some flowers to temporary obscurity,
but in many instances has restored them to their old
rank or to a higher one. In my youth the tulip filled every
border in yard and garden, but in time fashion called it vulgar,
and it retired from the floral social life. But it returned in
due season, like a girl from a fashionable school with the flush
of beauty and with cultivated taste, and became instead of the
wall flower, one of the belles of the ball. The hollyhock once
banished to the back yard, is now the guardian of our doorway,
and nods a graceful welcome to every guest, while the sunflower,
once the occupant of the poultry yard, now stands in
splendid defiance under our windows, and hourly challenges
the sun to do his best.</p>

<p>The most remarkable change in our gardens has been in connection
with the tomato introduced from Mexico, and there
called tomatl. In 1831 Dr. Jas. Thacher of Plymouth, who
was fond of introducing new things, secured some seed and
gave my mother some, which she planted. I remember the
plant well, with its burdens of gorgeous fruit, which was looked
upon rather as a garden ornament than food for the table.
It was not long, however, before it came into general use as a
summer vegetable, and finally as a preserve in cans for winter
use, until it may now be said that in the extent of its use it
stands next to the potato. Though long supposed to have
been of Mexican origin, it has been recently found that nations
in Africa had long used it, and esteemed it a valuable article of
food. I have an impression that in the summer of 1831 it
ripened much earlier than it does now. It is a serious objection
that as a crop it ripens so late that practically the whole
crop ripens at the same time, and as a perishable vegetable is
rushed into the market at prices too low to make its cultivation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
profitable. The canning, however, of large quantities, has
served in recent years to help prices by increasing the demand.
A writer in Blackwood says, “the tomato is a noble fruit, as
sweet in smell as the odors of Araby, and makes an illustrious
salad. Its medicinal virtue is as great as its gastronomical
goodness. It is the friend of the well to keep them well, and
the friend of the sick to bring them back into the lost sheepfolds
of Hygeia. The Englishman’s travelling companion, the
blue pill, would never be needed if he would pay proper court
to the tomato.”</p>

<p>Among the fruits brought into use in Plymouth from foreign
fields, the banana has had the most striking history. I remember
the first one I ever saw, and the first brought to Plymouth.
It was about the year 1833 that Capt. Samuel Rogers
in command of the schooner Capitol, belonging to Daniel and
Abraham Jackson, brought to Plymouth several bunches of bananas,
one of which he gave to Mr. Abraham Jackson, in
whose yard I saw it hanging on a tree. The bunch was of the
yellow variety, and Capt. Rogers called it plantain. As the
demand for this fruit has increased, the banana fields of Porto
Rico, Jamaica and Costa Rica have been immensely enlarged
until regular lines of steamers from those places now bring
into the United States twenty-five millions of bunches annually,
or twenty-five hundred millions of bananas, enough to supply
annually thirty bananas to every man, woman and child, including
negroes. The fruit is now sold at so low a price, and
is so universally used that I think it safe to say that no fruit,
not excepting apples, has so large a consumption.</p>

<p>The most striking change in fruits during my time has been
in the cultivation of cranberries. They have always been
known as a native of New England, and John Smith found
them in a visit here in 1614. They have always found their
best natural growth in grassy meadows or swamps, where decay
of vegetable matter has supplied the soil with organic
acids. I know some patches of such meadows today where
the cranberry has borne fruit hundreds of years. These natural
berries are better than the cultivated ones, probably because
the sand with which the made bog is covered has diminished
the supply of organic acids. The general consumer has
not yet discovered that the native berry weighs a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
pounds more to the bushel than the cultivated one, and has a
richer flavor. In 1855 the statistics of Plymouth showed an
acre and a half of cranberry bog valued at $15—while at the
present time there are 984 acres valued at $393,600.</p>

<p>Some fruits which were abundant in our gardens during my
youth, have entirely disappeared. I knew then scarcely a
garden without its plums, gages and damsons, the latter of
which were especially prized for preserving. When it is asked
what has become of these trees, it is often answered that they
have run out. But such an answer is absurd, because if they
had run out in one place, they would have run out everywhere.
But the plum and gage are raised in California and sold in
Boston and Plymouth at a profit to the producer after a travel
of three thousand miles across the continent. The trouble is
that the soil has run out after nearly three centuries of cultivation
without renewal of those properties and ingredients
which successive crops have exhausted. If the virgin soils of
California were analyzed, and their fertilizing constituents
when discovered were applied to our worn out gardens, they
would doubtless be rejuvenated. Our people have not even
been content with robbing the ground of its crops without
adding to and restoring its vitality, but they have year after
year raked out every stone, great and small, leaving the ground
a mere black paste, instead of a vigorous loam. They have
yet to learn that the feldspar in granite contains potash enough
if we knew how to extract it to fertilize the fields in which the
farmer looks on stones as nuisances to be rid of. I have seen
some evidence in the rank growth of grass around stone heaps
and under stone walls that nature may have found some method
by chemical action of eliminating the feldspar potash which the
rocks contain. The condition of the trees on Boston Common,
of which in late years we have heard much complaint illustrates
in my opinion the necessity of restoring to the soil precisely
those qualities which year after year the trees have been using
up. Mr. Doogue, the superintendent, last season, or the season
before, ploughed the ground and planted grain as if the
surface needed loosening and enriching to permit the access of
rain to the roots of the trees, but I do not believe that he has
reached or remedied the trouble. If he would come to Plymouth
I could show him by an object lesson what the trees need.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
Let him make a visit to our woods, where with no more than
two inches of soil on a substratum of sand and gravel, a thick
growth of oaks and pines sends up every season a foot or more
of upward growth, and preserves through the dryest summers
a rich foliage. They simply live on the leaves which they shed
in the autumn for their own use, and which they find in the
spring that no robber has carried away. If Mr. Doogue, instead
of raking the common and carting off the leaves will deposit
them in trenches around the trees covered with a little
earth, his trees will doubtless revive.</p>

<p>Among the trees which have practically disappeared in my
day are the Buttonwood and Balm of Gilead. The Buttonwood
or Sycamore or Plane tree, grew in various localities
within the town, and until about the year 1845, a row of Buttonwoods
stood on the front of the lot which now includes
Cushman street and the lots on both sides. Jas. Russell
Lowell was undoubtedly familiar with it when he wrote in his
“Beaver Brook.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beneath a bony buttonwood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mill’s red door swings open wide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whitened miller, dust imbued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flits past the square of dark inside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Buttonwood bush is an entirely distinct plant deriving
its name from the globules it bears resembling buttons in shape.</p>

<p>There was during my youth a row of Balm of Gileads or
Balsam poplars five or six in number, standing below the stone
wall opposite the North side of the Plymouth Rock House.
The buds of the trees covered with a resinous matter, were
much sought after as cures for cuts and wounds. Only a
very few of these trees are now standing in Plymouth.</p>

<p>There is the hornbeam tree often spoken of in the division
of lands in the early days of Plymouth Colony, of which very
few specimens are now found in our woods. Wood in “New
England’s Prospect,” under date of 1639 says, “the horn bound
tree is a tough kind of wood that requires so much pains in
riving as is almost incredible; being the best to make bowls
and dishes, not being subject to crack or leak.” He says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The horn-bound tree that to be cloven scorns;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from the tender vine oft takes his spouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who twines embracing arms about his boughs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The trees of New England seem to have been the same as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
those which were natives of England. The English poet
Spencer in the first book of the first canto of “The Færie Queen”
enumerates the latter in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Much can they praise the trees so straight and hy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sayling Pine; the Cedar proud and tall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vine-propt Elme; the Popplar never dry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Aspine, good for staves; the Cypresse funerall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Laurell, meed of mightie conquerors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And poets sage; the Firre that weepeth still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Willow, worne of forlorne paramours;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Eugh, obedient to the bender’s will;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Birch for shaftes; the Sallow for the mill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Mirrhe, sweete-bleeding in the bitter wound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warlike Beech; the Ash for nothing ill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fruitful Olive, and the Platane round;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The corner Holme; the Maple seldom inward sound.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sapling pine was the tree of which staffs were made;
the builders’ oak was the white oak; the sallow was a kind of
willow; the platane was the plane, and the holm was the holly.
The olive may have been some tree now known by another
name.</p>

<p>The beech tree at one time within my recollection was almost
extinct in Plymouth woods, and was rarely found except
on islands in the woodland ponds. I have heard that the
same was true of the beech in the Middlesex Fells, which suggests
that woods fires which could not reach the islands may
have thinned the beeches out. The fact that in recent years
the beech is again making its appearance in the Plymouth Park
and other protected localities, adds force to the suggestion.</p>

<p>Elm trees have always abounded in New England, doubtless
including Plymouth, and are much handsomer than the English
elms, though the latter retaining the custom of their habitat,
leave out earlier in the spring than the American, and
hold their leaves longer in the autumn. As far as I know
there is no positive record of an elm tree from the natural forests
in New England. The ages of the old elm on the Common
in Boston, and of the Brookline and Pittsfield elms, is not
known. There are contemporary records of an elm in New
York city, standing on the corner of Wall and Broad streets as
late as 1670, which measured more than thirty feet in circumference,
and was called by the Dutch, “der Groot Tree.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
trees now standing in Town Square, three of the five planted
by my great-grandfather, Thomas Davis, in 1784, are young
compared with the New York tree, and ought not to be in the
languishing condition they now exhibit. With the ground in
the square packed solid, it is impossible for rains to reach their
roots. If a fence were built around each tree, and the ground
within it dug up and kept loose, there can be no doubt that
water would find its way to the roots and along them to the
most distant rootlets. There is the same trouble with all the
ornamental trees along our concreted sidewalks. We are
spending hundreds of dollars each year in spraying their foliage
to check the ravages of the beetle and miller, and at the
same time by grass and concrete and macadamizing sentencing
them to certain death. I commend the subject to the
Plymouth Natural History Society, who on examination of
the beautiful tree in the front of the new fire station, a central
jewel in our coronet of trees, will find that we have been pursuing
the policy of a physician who would treat a patient for
loss of hair, who is dying of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>Among other adopted trees are the European Linden, and
the English Birch. Mr. George B. Emerson, the eminent
naturalist, told me once he thought the latter the most beautiful
tree in America. It undoubtedly has the merit of putting out
its leaves earlier than our trees, and holding them longer, but I
have never seen one standing erect if alone, or if more than
forty years old retaining life and vigor in its upper branches.
On the other hand I think the European Linden, of which we
have noble specimens in Plymouth, is on the whole the most
satisfactory ornamental tree for a bleak sea exposure like that
of Plymouth. I have found in Holland, the country of Lindens,
none to compare with the Lindens on North street, which
grow straight and regular, under blasting winds, and I have
seen them as late as the 6th of October without a yellow leaf.</p>

<p>Of the animals and birds and their changes within my day, I
can say little. They are very much the same as in the days
of the Pilgrims. The wild turkey disappeared before my
time, and I think that they are only to be found in Massachusetts
today in the Berkshire hills. All through my youth
the wild pigeons were abundant in our grain fields and huckleberry
woods, but they are now rare. Martins also were flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
about our houses, and nearly every householder had a martin
box under the eaves of his dwelling, or on a staff standing in
his yard. The English sparrow stole their nests, and they fled
like the aborigines before the English immigrant.</p>

<p>The fish are the same as those described by Wood and Josselyn,
writers in Pilgrim days, some, however having disappeared
for a time and returned. I remember being at Holmes
Hole during the Civil War, and being told that the weak fish
or squeteague had returned after an absence of twenty-five
years. In Josselyn’s New England’s rareties a fish called
Gurnard is spoken of, and is also mentioned in a poem by
Steendamn, a Dutchman, written, perhaps, about 1640 or 1650,
in the following lines, descriptive of fish in New York waters:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The bream and sturgeon, drum fish and gurnard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sea-bass which a prince would not discard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cod and salmon cooked with due regard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most palatable.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I am anxious to know what fish under its American name the
gurnard is. The Gurnet, at the entrance of Plymouth harbor,
was named after a headland in the English Channel, which in
shape resembled the Gurnet, a fish in English waters. On the
coast of Wales there is another headland named Gurnard, after
the fish gurnard, the French name of the fish called in English,
gurnet. The gurnard has lost its French name with us, and
I was not aware until I saw the name in Wood and Josselyn,
that the gurnet fish was found in our waters under the name
of gurnard.</p>

<p>There was a piece of household furniture in my youth which
I believe has gone out of use. The trundle bed was introduced
by the Dutch, by whom it was called “een slaapbauck
op rollen.” The bedsteads were universally four posted and
high enough from the floor to permit the trundle bed to be kept
under it, and to be rolled out at night when the younger children
were sent to bed. When the baby grew to be too large
for the cradle, or was deposed by a new comer, it was promoted
to the trundle bed, and when a newer comer appeared
the trundle bed held two until the bedstead, with its chintz
curtains, became the court of last resort. In old Colonial days
the bedsteads were made of sassafras wood, which was believed
to be an effectual protection against vermin. For hundreds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
years the curative properties of sassafras were highly esteemed
by the Indians, and when Champlain first sailed up the St.
Lawrence he carried back to France large quantities of it to be
used especially as a cure for venereal diseases. Within my
day sassafras poles have been used as roosts in hen houses as
a protection against hen lice.</p>

<p>The treatment of whiskers has changed almost as often as
each generation came on the stage. The use of the razor is
as old as the history of man. In the book of Isaiah it is written
in the twentieth verse of the seventh chapter, “In the same
day shall the Lord shave with a razor.” Ezekiel, in the first
verse of chapter five says, “Take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
barber’s razor and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy
beard.” Pliny states that barbers were common in his time,
though only a short time before beards were allowed to grow.
He also speaks of spider webs, applied with oil and vinegar to
cuts received in barber shops, and also speaks of hones and
whetstones for sharpening razors. In the time of Adrian
beards were again allowed to grow, and so the changes and
fashions went on. In the time of Queen Elizabeth the wearing
of beards was controlled by law, and it was ordered that
no fellow of Lincoln’s Inn should wear a beard of more than
two weeks’ growth. The barber’s brush was introduced in
modern times. A writer named Stubb, in a work entitled
“Anatomy of Abuses,” published about 1550, in speaking of
barbers, wrote, “When they came to washing, oh, how gingerly
they behave themselves therein. For then shall your mouths
be bossed with the lather or some that runneth off the balls,
your eyes closed must be anointed therewith also.” In the
very beginning of the last century a poetical wag wrote the
following lines showing that at that time the face was clean
shaved by barbers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Strap that razor so keen! strap that razor again!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Smallpiece will shave em, if he can come at em;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his stool clad in aprons, he springs up amain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a barber refreshed by the smell of pomatum.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the place where he lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He leaps in array</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lather and shave in the face of the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has sworn from pollution our faces to clean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our cheeks, necks and upper lips, whiskers and chin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span></p>
<p>In 1829 a public meeting was held in New York against
whiskers, and about the same time there was a movement in
Plymouth against them. Barbers and surgeons were incorporated
as one company in the fifteenth century, and were
called barber surgeons. Henry the Eighth dissolved the
union and gave a new charter in 1540, in which it was provided
“That no person using any shaving or barbery in London,
shall occupy any surgery, letting of blood or other matter,
excepting only the drawing of teeth.” Under the law barbers
and surgeons were each to use a pole, that of the barber’s,
blue and white striped, and that of the surgeon’s, the same,
with the addition of a galipot and a red rag. As near as I
can learn the use of a pole began as early as the 13th century,
when “a staff bound by a riband was held by persons being
bled, and the pole was intended to denote the practice of blood
letting.” The staff was about three feet long, with a ball on the
top and a fillet or tape attached, which when not in use was
wound around it. So that the present barber’s pole represents
a part of the barber’s business, that of blood letting, which long
since passed to the prerogative of the surgeon.</p>

<p>During my youth beards were unknown among Americans,
and until 1852 I do not think that a person of any nationality
had in my time ever worn a moustache in Plymouth. In the
summer of 1854, while occupying for a time the house now occupied
by Col. Wm. P. Stoddard, I was confined to the house
by illness about three weeks, and during that time permitted
my moustache to grow, intending to shave it off before going
into the street. When I had recovered sufficiently to go out
I took an airing in the carriage of the late Ephraim Finney,
having failed to carry out my intention, and my appendage was
so roundly condemned by all my friends that I permitted it to
grow, and I have never parted with it since. During the next
summer a meeting of the descendants of Elder Thomas Cushman,
was held in Plymouth, and Rev. Dr. Robert W. Cushman,
the orator of the occasion was a guest with his wife at my
house. I heard of his saying after he returned home, that he
stayed with me while in Plymouth, and then adding—what a
pity that a man like Mr. Davis should wear a moustache. I
doubt whether there are many older moustaches in Massachusetts
than mine.</p>

<p>The habits of our people in the use of tobacco have been
somewhat changeable. The use outside of medicine and surgery
has been confined to smoking, chewing, snuffing and dipping.
The last is practiced by applying moistened snuff with
a brush to the gums, and has never been resorted to in New
England to any considerable extent. I am inclined to think
that it has been chiefly confined to the poor whites in the South.
Snuff taking is a habit introduced into New England at a
comparatively recent period, and of course was unknown to the
aborigines. Its use had, however, a rapid growth, when once
introduced, and in my youth was common among our people of
both sexes, though I am inclined to think more so among women
than men. In every grocery store there always stood on
the counter two jars of snuff, and this fact alone shows its extensive
use. I cannot recall more than thirty persons who
were in the habit of carrying snuff boxes, and these did not
belong to any special class or occupation. I remember that
during the sessions of the Supreme and Common Pleas Courts
an open box of snuff always lay on the clerk’s desk, and was
frequently visited by the members of the bar, as well as by the
judges on the bench.</p>

<p>It is said that of all the tobacco habits that of snuff taking is
the most difficult to abandon. The story is told of Charles
Lamb and Thomas Hone, both inveterate snuffers, walking
one day on Hamstead Heath, and coming to the resolution to
give up the habit, threw their snuff boxes away. The next
morning Lamb visited the Heath to recover his box, and there
encountered Hone hunting in the shrubbery for his.</p>

<p>The practice of smoking is ancient. While the use of
cigars in England and the United States cannot be traced
to a period earlier than 1700, pipes were used by the aborigines,
and have been found in the ancient mounds of the West.
Whether tobacco was smoked before the days of the Pilgrims,
so far as New England was concerned, is doubtful, while at an
earlier period the natives of the South and West undoubtedly
both used and cultivated it. It is certain that as late as King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
Phillip’s War in 1676, the New England Indian, while smoking
tobacco when he could get it, used various substitutes. On
this point we have the testimony of Mrs. Rowlandson, the wife
of the minister of Lancaster, Mass., who was captured by the
Indians and confined in the Camp of King Phillip. When a
messenger was sent to King Phillip to negotiate for her release,
she sent back word asking her husband to send her some tobacco
for Phillip. She stated in a later narrative that when she
saw Phillip, “he bade me come in and sit down, and asked me
whether I would smoke it, but this no way suited me. For
though I had formerly used tobacco, yet I had left it ever since
I was first taken. It seems to be a bait the devil lays to make
men loose their precious time. I remember with shame how
formerly when I had taken two or three pipes I was presently
ready for another, such a bewitching ‘thing’ it is, but I thank
God he has now given me power over it; surely there are many
who may be better employed than to lie sucking a stinking ‘tobacco
pipe.’” She further said that the Indians for want of
tobacco smoked hemlock and ground ivy. From the above
statement it will be seen that smoking was common to both
sexes. The laws, however, from a very early period, were
rigid in their provisions against smoking in public places. In
1638 the General Court ordered “that no man shall take any tobacco
within twenty poles of any house, or so near as may endanger
the same.” One of the latest statutes on the subject
was passed in 1798, which “forbade carrying fire through the
streets, except in a covered vessel, as well as smoking or having
in one’s possession any lighted pipe or cigar in the streets
or on the wharves.” This law remained in force many years.
In 1835 a by-law was adopted by the town of Plymouth, which
I believe has never been repealed, forbidding smoking in any
street, lane, public square or wharf within the town. I do
not remember to have seen in all my boyhood any person smoking
about the streets, or at his work. No ship carpenter in his
yard, no rigger on the mast, no blacksmith at the forge, no digger
in the garden or street, ever held a pipe in his mouth, wasting
the time of his employer, in cutting tobacco, and filling his
pipe. It was not because the practice was an expensive one,
but because the fashion of the day was opposed to it. The
mechanic and the farmer smoked in a leisure hour, or after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
meal, but no woman was seen at home or in the field, or anywhere
else smoking at all. Doctors and lawyers smoked occasionally
in their offices, business men rarely behind their
counters, while a minister who used tobacco in any form was
unknown. In later years, however, smoking has become a
frequent practice among the clergy, but so far as my observation
has gone, chiefly among those of the Episcopalian and Unitarian
denominations. I once detected in the cheek of an
eminent divine a suspicious swelling, and when I spoke of it,
he said that it was his invariable habit to preach with a cud of
tobacco in his mouth. Since the early days of which I speak,
pipe smoking has largely taken the place of cigar smoking,
and the use of both cigars and pipes has found its way into
times and places where forty years ago it would not have been
tolerated. Several causes have contributed to this change.
In the first place cigars were much cheaper in 1840 and 1850,
and their higher cost has led to the more economical use of the
pipe. When I began to smoke in 1838, Havana cigars sold at
retail at five dollars a quarter box of two hundred and fifty.
The same cigars today would cost twenty dollars. In the second
place the coming in of foreigners largely increased the use
of the pipe, and lastly the Civil War taught the use of the pipe
to soldiers in the camp, who under normal conditions would
not have taken it up. Now we are seeing, to say nothing of
smelling, either the cigar or the pipe everywhere, in the street,
in the office, in court houses, in the state house, between the
lips of the mechanic at his work, the provision dealer on his
cart, and indeed almost in every place except the pulpit and
school, from which it is a matter of congratulation that they
are yet excluded. Being a smoker myself, I cannot be charged
with prejudice when I express the opinion that this excessive
and ill-timed use of tobacco not only violates rules of good
taste and propriety, but is well nigh a nuisance.</p>

<p>The habit of using tooth picks is of recent origin. In Boston
on any day between twelve and two o’clock, nearly every
third woman met in the vicinity of Winter and West streets,
has a tooth pick between her lips. This practice is made more
vulgar when at table the hand is held over the mouth, for
thus its vulgarity is acknowledged by those who persist in it.</p>

<p>The changing fashions in dress have been so constant that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
it is futile to attempt to trace them. The greatest change in
the United States occurred at the close of the revolution, when
what was called republican simplicity took the place of the
dress which characterized the first three-quarters of the 18th
century of which such fine illustrations may be found in the
works of Smybert, Blackburn and Copley. There is something
absurd about this so-called republican simplicity, which
compels a representative of our government to appear at foreign
courts in the garb of an American citizen, while he has
his residence in one of the most lordly houses in London, and
makes it the vogue for a bridegroom to appear at his wedding
with nothing but the color of his skin to distinguish him from
the colored waiter, while he sets up a livery and hunts through
Herald’s college for a coat of arms to have painted on the
door of his carriage. I am inclined to think that a false pride
in the supposed possession of aristocratic blood has more to do
with the formation of so-called patriotic societies than a true
patriotic spirit.</p>

<p>In speaking of dress let me begin with the young. In my
school days I wore a blue jacket with brass buttons and a stiff
linen collar buttoned to it on the inside, and turned over the
collar of the jacket. I never wore an overcoat, or even owned
one, and when I entered college, the first thing I did was to
go to John Earle, the tailor, and get measured for a long tail
broadcloth coat, and buy a camlet cloak. The frock coat was
unknown, and the cloak was indispensable in attending prayers
when hastily jumping out of bed I hurried to chapel often with
nothing under it but a night gown and trousers and boots.
During the summer months many boys went barefooted, not on
account of poverty, but simply for economy. A writer in the
<cite>Old Colony Memorial</cite> in 1837 misrepresented this custom in
the statement that “old men had a great coat and a pair of
boots, the boots generally lasting for life. Shoes and stockings
were not worn by the young men, and by but few men in
farming business, and young women in their ordinary work
did not wear stockings and shoes.” I suppose that during the
school season there are fewer barefooted boys then formerly,
but at other times I do not think that there has been any change
as to footwear. As to overcoats I have known many persons
who went without them from preference in the coldest weather.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
Nathaniel Ingersoll Bowditch of Boston never wore one, and
my old schoolmate, George Sampson, the late proprietor of the
Boston directory, never did. I met the latter one afternoon in
Boston when the thermometer was about zero, and I said,
“George, I suspect that on such a day as this you wear a thicker
undershirt?” To my surprise he said that he had never
worn an undershirt in his life. I propose in speaking of dress
to confine myself to those articles worn at various times which
would strike the present generation as strange. About the
year 1840, gentlemen’s boots were two inches longer than the
foot, and turned up like the dasher of a sleigh. At about the
same time, or a little earlier, trousers skin tight, put on necessarily
with the boots already in them, were worn, and then
immediately after loose trousers with plaits. For many years
after the revolution, and continuing into my own days, the
woolen cloths, of which dresses were made, were often spun
and woven at home. During the 18th century in the small
towns and country districts, nearly every family made a coarse
cloth called lindsy-woolsy, with the warp of linen and the woof
of wool. It is a mistake to suppose that in the earliest colonial
times spinning wheels were much used until fulling mills
were built in the last half of the 17th century, and it is not
probable that Priscilla Alden ever used one until she was forty
years of age. The small wheels known as flax wheels were
first brought to Boston by the Scotch Irish in the first quarter
of the 18th century. Of all articles of dress there is none in
my opinion which so unerringly stamps the lady as a neat, tidy
footgear. I say it with fear and trembling, but here goes,
there must also be a white stocking. The contour of the foot
is destroyed by a shoe, especially one without a heel, and the
outlines of the ankle and limb are lost on any other color than
white. The hat comes next, not set on the head like a liberty
cap on a pole, but one whether large or small, as much belonging
to the figure as the lily to its stem. Then comes the glove,
never white in the street, a well fitting dress, not necessarily of
expensive material, and withall as few ornaments as possible,
and you have so far as flesh and blood are concerned, a faultless
woman. A eulogist of the late Susan B. Anthony, herself
a noble woman, said that she never was afraid to see her
friend mount a table or platform to speak, because she knew
that her boots and stockings were immaculate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span></p>

<p>Ear-rings, concerning which I find many interesting items
in the work of Alice Morse Earle on costumes, have come
down to us from a period as early as the 16th century. They
were, however, in their early days, worn by men more than
by women, and in many cases only in one ear. Charles the
First, on going to execution, wore a pearl pear shaped ear-ring,
about five-eighths of an inch long, which is now owned by the
Duke of Portland; and Shakespeare and Sir Walter Raleigh
wore them. In my youth their use among women was almost
universal, and I can recall many men who wore plain gold
rings, and every young lady on leaving school had her ears
bored as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Among the bonnets at various times in fashion I shall refer
alone to the poke bonnet because its etymology is a little confused.
This bonnet had plaits around its crown and sides.
One of the many definitions of the word poke given in the
Century dictionary, which no library is complete without, is,
“to poke plaits in a ruff,” and I have no doubt that “poke bonnet”
meant merely a bonnet with plaits poked in the ruff. I
must omit the scarlet cloak with its black silk quilted hood,
worn by elderly women in my youth, the busks worn in the
corsets, made of whalebone, steel or wood, the bustles below the
waist behind, the quilted mandarins for cold weather, the India
shawls now packed away in cedar closets awaiting their return
in the revolving wheel of fashion, turbans, lace caps, night
caps, hoops and other female paraphernalia, forming a sea
without a shore, and speak lastly of pattens, which in my early
boyhood were giving place to the overshoe and rubbers.</p>

<p>I remember a pair of pattens in an old closet where they
had been consigned to an undeserved exile after many centuries
of faithful service. The patten consisted of a wooden stock
like the stock of a skate, with an oval iron ring attached to its
under side, and with toe and heel pieces fastened by straps to
the foot and ankle, its purpose being to protect the foot from
mud and slush. It can be traced back to the 14th century,
when it was called the galoe-shoe or galoshe. After its introduction
into France, where it was called patin, the English galoshe
became patten, but as if to revenge itself against the
usurper, it has had a resurrection, and now lives in its legitimate
successor, the galoshe of the present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span></p>

<p>I shall devote a portion of this chapter to a mention of those
words and phrases which have made their appearance at various
times, and have become incorporated for a longer or shorter
time in the language of our people. Only a few of these are
peculiar to Plymouth. Some have come down to us from
our English ancestors, some owe their origin to the different
languages of continental Europe, some are slang, which have
found their way through unknown channels into the speech of
men, and a few through ignorance of orthography have found
a place in colloquial use. My reference to these must be restricted
by necessarily limited space.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may be surprised at the number of words
and names which have come to us from foreign tongues, and
have made themselves as much at home as if they were to the
manor born. We have the word wharf from the Swedish
hworf, and the word dock from the Gothic dok, lane from the
Dutch laan, alley from the French allee, derived from the verb
aller, to go. The verb tedder meaning to ted or spread hay
was introduced by the Irish when they began to work on our
farms. Fishermen in Gloucester, Provincetown and Plymouth
and other places, after drying codfish on flakes, yaffle
them up and carry them into the fish house. The word yaffle
is old English, and means an armful and the word stadle is
the Scotch stathel, and means the stakes driven into a salt
meadow, on which salt hay is to be piled. Scuttle comes
from the French escoutelle, and the word kench, which means
the bin in which salt codfish are piled, is old English. The
word kid not only stands for an animal, but is also the name
of the square bin on the deck of a fishing vessel by the side
of each fisherman, in which he throws his fish. Sailors got into
the way of calling any box without a cover a kid. I remember
a story told by my mother when I was a boy of her
going to church and finding a strange man in her pew, who
jumped over the rail into the next pew, saying, I beg your
pardon, Madam, I got into the wrong kid. The word coverlid,
often called coverlet, is French derived from the French
word couvrelit, cover bed. The word sass applied to vegetables,
and also meaning impudence, is not as many suppose,
a Yankee slang word, but has an English origin, and is still
used in the county of Essex, in England. The word cabbage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
as applied to the vegetable, came from Holland, and was introduced
into England by Sir Anthony Ashley. He was accused
of securing much loot, while holding a command in
Spain, and he was so closely associated with the vegetable in
the public mind, that on his monument at Wimbourne the
head of a cabbage was sculptured, and in consequence of his
looting the word became applied to looting in general, and
finally to the odds and ends saved by tailors in their trade.
The word arter, for after, came down to us from England, and
if I remember right, was used by Governor Bradford in his
history. The word fetch is an old Saxon word, used by Bacon,
Shakespeare and many other old writers, and is worthy of
respect, and continued use, though at present excluded from
elegant speech. The word fetching expressing attractiveness
in beauty or dress is a comparatively recent half slang
innovation. The origin of the word contraptions, meaning
new notions, I do not know, but I have heard it
many times in my day. Arey or airey came from England,
where it was sometimes called arrow or narrow. Hearth in
two syllables, with emphasis on the e is a word I have never
heard out of Plymouth. As long as I can remember it has
been used by the deer hunters in Plymouth woods. Once
Branch Pierce, the famous hunter, put Daniel Webster on a
stand, and later in the day called out to him that the dogs had
been out of hearth an hour, and that the hunt was up. The
word dike as applied to a sloping grassy bank or terrace, is
universal in Plymouth, and as far as I know, never used in
that sense anywhere except in Plymouth, and its vicinity.
Crojeck or crotchet, is a common corruption of cross jack in
Plymouth and elsewhere as applied to the lower yard on the
mizzen mast of a ship. Chimley for chimney, has been common
in Scotland, and may be found in Scott’s Rob Roy. In
the United States it is usually spelled chimbley, but it is rarely
heard in Plymouth.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell has these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ag’in the chimbley crooknecks hung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ in amongs ’em, rusted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ole queen’s arm that granther Young</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fetched back from Concord, busted.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sun-up for sunrise, I do not remember to have heard in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
Plymouth more than once, but I have heard it often in other
Plymouth county towns. As the opposite of sun-down, which
is English, it seems as correct as sunset or sunrise, and may
be properly used. Bile is often used for boil, and has been
thought by some of the best writers to be more correct. It is,
however, going out of use. Brewis is an English word meaning
bread covered with broth, but when introduced into New
England, it was applied to rye and Indian crusts boiled with
milk and butter.</p>

<p>The word sleigh comes from the Dutch sluy; squash came
down from the aborigines, by whom it was called estata, or
vine apple; carrots came from Holland, and some growing
wild bore a flower which the English called Queen Anne’s lace.
The cochroach was the Dutch kackenlack; potatoes, which
have been said to have been introduced by the Irish, were raised
by the Dutch in New York as early as 1654, and were called
pataddes. It is not unlikely that as they were called Irish potatoes,
the slang word paddies applied to the Irish, came from
pataddes.</p>

<p>The word “certain” a few years ago came into use in answer
to certain questions as for instance—are you going to Boston
tomorrow? “Certain;” but it seems to have given place to
the word “sure.” For a time, “you bet,” was used in the same
way, as for instance to the statement, “that was a good dinner,”
the answer was, “you bet.” Chores probably comes from the
old English “char,” as does also the word “charwomen.” The
word cow pronounced kyou, has been said to be peculiar to
New England country towns, but there can be no greater mistake,
for I have heard it so pronounced by natives of South
Carolina, and it is so pronounced today in the shires of Essex
and Sussex, in England. Fornent or fornenst was originally a
Scotch word meaning opposite to, as for instance his house
was fornent the church. It was carried to Ireland, and by the
Irish introduced here. I heard it for the first time about 1854.
“Gab,” now common, was used by Chaucer as we use it. The
English laugh at the word “guess,” and call it a vulgar Americanism,
but it was used by Locke, Milton and Chaucer.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Her yellow hair was braided in a tress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind her back a yard long I guess.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Poke” in one of its many meanings is a pocket or bag, as in
the words, to buy a pig in a poke, that is without seeing it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
“Streak it,” to run fast, was heard by me for the first time when
hunting in the Plymouth woods. Branch Pierce, the hunter,
after placing his party on their stands would take his son Tom
and take short cuts through the woods to head off the deer.
When a good chance occurred the old man could be heard
calling out, Streak it, Tommy. There was another Thomas
Pierce living in the neighborhood, so in order to distinguish
them one was called Squire Tom, and the other Streak it Tommy.
I have never heard the word “seen” in the sense of saw
in Plymouth, but I have heard it frequently in Boston among
Englishmen and immigrants from the Dominion. Muckrakes
is a word recently rescued from oblivion, but with a wrong
understanding of its meaning. According to Professor DeVere,
now or late Professor of modern languages in the University
of Virginia, and author of “Studies in English” muckrakes
are those who rake for the purpose of finding something
valuable and worthy of preservation. Rag pickers are in one
sense muckrakes. There are two offensive words which have
recently found a lodgement in our vocabulary, chiefly, however,
among inexperienced writers. One of these words, “one,”
taken out of its legitimate meaning, seems to be due either to a
lack of taste or to a mistaken notion that it is elegant. The following
sentence explains what I mean. “When one writes a
letter one must be careful how one expresses oneself, lest one
finds that one makes a mistake in using too many ones.” The
other is the word “gotten,” which to me always suggests a writer
who fancies himself an accurate scholar, and would call aisle
of a church “oil,” and one of its pillars, a “pillow.” There are
two other words not offensive, but objectionable, which I find
constantly in new novels, “peering,” for looking, and “perturbed”
for disturbed, or agitated, or “annoyed.” As for instance
“in peering out of the window I was perturbed by an
unusual sight.”</p>

<p>The use of exaggerations and superlatives is every day becoming
more common. Newspaper reporters and associated
press men are responsible for many of these. With them it
never rains, but it pours, every snow spit is a blizzard, every
fresh breeze a gale, every gale a hurricane, every wave is
mountain high, every collision is a crash, and every crowd a
surging mob. New newspaper words are constantly creeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
into our vocabulary. Among the most recent are “defi” for
“defiance,” and “confer” for “conference.” There is another
class of words and phrases having their origin in athletics and
games of various kinds, which are constantly found in the
newspapers, and even in congressional and other speeches.
“Stand pat,” “win out,” “flush,” and “full deck” are
some of those which are unworthy of the press or
the speech of a legislator. There is still another class quite
frequently used which are really nothing but veiled oaths with
the spirit if not the letter of profanity behind them. Among
them are by-jingo, land-sakes, by-George, by-gum, by-thunder,
good-gracious, dern it, thunder and Mars, heavens and earth,
all fired for hell fired, gol darn it, darnation, Lord-a-mussy,
mercy sakes alive, great Scott, by the eternal, and lastly, tarnation,
as in the lines of John Noakes and May Styles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Poor honest John ’tis plain he knows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But little of life’s range.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or he’d a know’d gals oft at fust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have ways tarnation strange.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the above selections of words and phrases I have of course
omitted a large number, the origin and etomology of which it
would be interesting to trace. I must, however, in order to finish

<p>Here, my readers, these memories must close. Any pleasure
which you may have received in reading them has been
more than equalled by my own in writing them. They present
a meagre record of the memories of a long life whose beginning
and end are mysteries.</p>

<p>To the blacksmiths on page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, are to be added Nathan Delano
and Moses Nichols. Mr. Delano lived on Middle street,
and had his shop in the brick basement of the house, which
once stood on Cole’s Hill, with its rear on the way leading
from Middle street to Water street.</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols came to Plymouth from Freetown, and building
a shop in Chiltonville on the southwest corner of the Russell
Mills road, worked on a vessel building on Eel River, a little
below the Hayden factory. He later built a shop where the
George Fuller shop now stands, and lived in the house in Wellingsley,
lately occupied by John Bartlett. Still later he built
a shop in what is now called Dublin, and built and occupied
the house on the upper corner of Summer and Edes streets,
where he died about 1809. After his death, his son Otis
Nichols, born in the Bartlett house, occupied the Summer
street house until he moved to Manomet, and established the
farm now owned and occupied by his son Otis.</p>

<p>Among the whaling vessels mentioned on page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, was the
schooner Mercury. She sailed Nov. 12, 1842, and on the 2d
of May, 1843, capsized in a gale, and Wm. H. Godfrey, Henry
Missard, George L. Jones, Wm. Pierce and Wm. Hatch were
lost. The remainder of the crew, consisting of John Winslow
of Provincetown, Thomas D. Barnes, Lemuel Hall, Wm. H.
Carver, Richard Pierce and Isaac Cole of Plymouth, and Robert
Gardner and George Williams were taken off. When
the vessel capsized Richard Pierce was in the cabin, and was
taken out with a broken leg through a hole cut in the deck.
I remember him well a cripple through life.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
